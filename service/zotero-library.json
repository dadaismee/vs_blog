  {"id":"2023","abstract":"Social ontology studies the nature and properties of social reality while social metaontology examines the relationship between ontology and the social sciences, which is often treated as a normative question. However, social sciences themselves contain ontological theses, raising the descriptive question of how these internal ontologies relate to the rest of the social sciences. This paper argues that important parts of sociology have an anti-foundationalist metaontology. This descriptive claim is used to build a normative argument against foundationalism and is supported by examining the works of Durkheim and Weber and how their metaontological beliefs continue to influence many sociologists.","citation-key":"2023","DOI":"10.1177/00483931231210349","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,2]]},"note":"MAG ID: 4388220391","title":"Ontological Anti-Foundationalism in Sociology","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"шевченко2023","abstract":"The article discusses the problem of the naturalistic methodology of social ontology. Following Katherine Hawley's (2018) analysis, the author considers three approaches: conceptual analysis, the ameliorative (or normative) approach, and inference to the best explanation (from best social science to social ontology). Hawley concludes that only the first two can provide a viable naturalistic social metaphysics, and the latter cannot. The author, drawing on the notion of naturalistic limitations of social ontology, shows that only a conclusion to the best explanation can lead to a consistent realistic social ontology; this methodology avoids the problem of being rooted in concepts that do not have an empirical basis, which contradicts realism, and also does not imply normative prescription, which also contradicts the realistic description of the world. The problem critics attribute to inference to the best explanation — the lack of a predictively strong theoretical core of social theory from which to infer social ontology — can be resolved by satisfying three criteria (Turner, 2007): physical realizability, computability, and cognitive realism. The author proposes to implement them through the introduction of naturalistic restrictions into game theory. Formal models of coordination described by a correlated equilibrium — coupled with evolutionary explanations of the cognitive mechanisms responsible for the causal processes that make formally described coordination possible — may provide the desired theoretical core from which ontology can be derived.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",9,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Шевченко","given":"Валерий Сергеевич"}],"citation-key":"шевченко2023","container-title":"Социология власти","event-place":"Россия, Москва","ISSN":"2074-0492","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"number":"4","page":"122-140","publisher":"Федеральное государственное бюджетное образовательное учреждение высшего образования «Российская академия народного хозяйства и государственной службы при Президенте Российской Федерации»","publisher-place":"Россия, Москва","source":"cyberleninka.ru","title":"«Вывод к наилучшему объяснению» как методология социальной онтологии","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://cyberleninka.ru/article/n/vyvod-k-nailuchshemu-obyasneniyu-kak-metodologiya-sotsialnoy-ontologii","volume":"35"},

  {"id":"abreuzavaleta","abstract":"According to standard assumptions in semantics, (a) ordinary users of a language have implicit beliefs about the truth-conditions of sentences in that language, and (b) they often agree on those beliefs. For example, it is assumed that if Anna and John are both competent users of English and the former utters 'grass is green' in conversation with the latter, they will both believe that that sentence is true if and only if grass is green. These assumptions play an important role in an intuitively compelling picture of communication, according to which successful communication through literal assertoric utterances is normally effected thanks to our shared beliefs about the truth-conditions of the sentences uttered in the course of the conversation. Against these standard assumptions, this paper argues that the participants in a conversation rarely have the same beliefs about the truth-conditions of the sentences involved in a linguistic interaction. More precisely, it argues for Variance, the thesis that nearly every utterance is such that there is no proposition which more than one language user believes to be that utterance's truth-conditional content. If Variance is true, we must reject the standard picture of communication. Towards the end of the paper I identify three ways in which ordinary conversations can be communication-like despite the truth of Variance and argue that the most natural amendments to the standard picture fail to explain them.","author":[{"family":"Abreu Zavaleta","given":"Martín"}],"citation-key":"abreuzavaleta","container-title":"Topoi","DOI":"10.1007/s11245-019-09648-3","title":"Communication and Variance","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11245-019-09648-3?utm_source=researcher_app&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=RESR_MRKT_Researcher_inbound"},

Each individual receives a signal about the underlying state of the world, observes the past actions of a stochastically generated neighbourhood of individuals, and chooses one of two possible actions. The stochastic process generating the neighbourhoods defines the network topology. We characterize pure strategy equilibria for arbitrary stochastic and deterministic social networks and characterize the conditions under which there will be asymptotic learning—convergence (in probability) to the right action as the social network becomes large. We show that when private beliefs are unbounded (meaning that the implied likelihood ratios are unbounded), there will be asymptotic learning as long as there is some minimal amount of “expansion in observations”.

The combination of these cues in the analysis of social communication, however, has been a virtually neglected area of inquiry. Two studies were conducted to test the prediction that direct gaze would facilitate the processing of facially communicated approach-oriented emotions (e.g., anger and joy), whereas averted gaze would facilitate the processing of facially communicated avoidance-oriented emotions (e.g., fear and sadness). The results of both studies confirmed the central hypothesis and suggest that gaze direction and facial expression are combined in the processing of emotionally relevant facial information.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Adams","given":"Reginald B."},{"family":"Kleck","given":"Robert E."}],"citation-key":"adams2003","container-title":"Psychological Science","container-title-short":"Psychol Sci","DOI":"10.1046/j.0956-7976.2003.psci_1479.x","ISSN":"0956-7976","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2003",11,1]]},"language":"en","page":"644-647","publisher":"SAGE Publications Inc","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Perceived Gaze Direction and the Processing of Facial Displays of Emotion","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1046/j.0956-7976.2003.psci_1479.x","volume":"14"},

  {"id":"akcay2012","abstract":"An unresolved controversy regarding social behaviors is exemplified when natural selection might lead to behaviors that maximize fitness at the social-group level but are costly at the individual level. Except for the special case of groups of clones, we do not have a general understanding of how and when group-optimal behaviors evolve, especially when the behaviors in question are flexible. To address this question, we develop a general model that integrates behavioral plasticity in social interactions with the action of natural selection in structured populations. We find that group-optimal behaviors can evolve, even without clonal groups, if individuals exhibit appropriate behavioral responses to each other’s actions. The evolution of such behavioral responses, in turn, is predicated on the nature of the proximate behavioral mechanisms. We model a particular class of proximate mechanisms, prosocial preferences, and find that such preferences evolve to sustain maximum group benefit under certain levels of relatedness and certain ecological conditions. Thus, our model demonstrates the fundamental interplay between behavioral responses and relatedness in determining the course of social evolution. We also highlight the crucial role of proximate mechanisms such as prosocial preferences in the evolution of behavioral responses and in facilitating evolutionary transitions in individuality.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Akçay","given":"Erol"},{"family":"Cleve","given":"Jeremy Van"}],"citation-key":"akcay2012","container-title":"The American Naturalist","DOI":"10.1086/663691","ISSN":"0003-0147","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",2,1]]},"page":"257-269","publisher":"The University of Chicago Press","source":"journals.uchicago.edu (Atypon)","title":"Behavioral Responses in Structured Populations Pave the Way to Group Optimality.","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/663691","volume":"179"},
  {"id":"akcay2020","abstract":"Evolution of social behaviors is one of the most fascinating and active fields of evolutionary biology. During the past half century, social evolution theory developed into a mature field with powerful tools to understand the dynamics of social traits such as cooperation under a wide range of conditions. In this article, I argue that the next stage in the development of social evolution theory should consider the evolution of the setting in which social behaviors evolve. To that end, I propose a conceptual map of the components that make up the evolutionary setting of social behaviors, review existing work that considers the evolution of each component, and discuss potential future directions. The theoretical work reviewed here illustrates how unexpected dynamics can happen when the setting of social evolution itself is evolving, such as cooperation sometimes being self-limiting. I argue that a theory of how the setting of social evolution itself evolves will lead to a deeper understanding of when cooperation and other social behaviors evolve and diversify.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Akçay","given":"Erol"}],"citation-key":"akcay2020","container-title":"The American Naturalist","DOI":"10.1086/706811","ISSN":"0003-0147","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",2]]},"page":"315-330","publisher":"The University of Chicago Press","source":"journals.uchicago.edu (Atypon)","title":"Deconstructing Evolutionary Game Theory: Coevolution of Social Behaviors with Their Evolutionary Setting","title-short":"Deconstructing Evolutionary Game Theory","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/706811","volume":"195"},
  {"id":"albert2014","abstract":"The biomolecules inside or near cells form a complex interacting system. Cellular phenotypes and behaviors arise from the totality of interactions among the components of this system. A fruitful way of modeling interacting biomolecular systems is by network-based dynamic models that characterize each component by a state variable, and describe the change in the state variables due to the interactions in the system. Dynamic models can capture the stable state patterns of this interacting system and can connect them to different cell fates or behaviors. A Boolean or logic model characterizes each biomolecule by a binary state variable that relates the abundance of that molecule to a threshold abundance necessary for downstream processes. The regulation of this state variable is described in a parameter free manner, making Boolean modeling a practical choice for systems whose kinetic parameters have not been determined. Boolean models integrate the body of knowledge regarding the components and interactions of biomolecular systems, and capture the system's dynamic repertoire, for example the existence of multiple cell fates. These models were used for a variety of systems and led to important insights and predictions. Boolean models serve as an efficient exploratory model, a guide for follow-up experiments, and as a foundation for more quantitative models.

  {"id":"anderson2016","abstract":"Emerging over the past ten years from a set of post-structuralist theoretical lineages, non-representational theories are having a major impact within Human Geography. Non-representational theorisation and research has opened up new sets of problematics around the body, practice and performativity and inspired new ways of doing and writing human geography that aim to engage with the taking-place of everyday life. Drawing together a range of innovative contributions from leading writers, this is the first book to provide an extensive and in-depth overview of non-representational theories and human geography. The work addresses the core themes of this still-developing field, demonstrates the implications of non-representational theories for many aspects of human geographic thought and practice, and highlights areas of emergent critical debate. The collection is structured around four thematic sections - Life, Representation, Ethics and Politics - which explore the varied relations between non-representational theories and contemporary human geography.","author":[{"family":"Anderson","given":"Ben"}],"citation-key":"anderson2016","ISBN":"978-1-317-04696-7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",4,1]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"393","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Google Books","title":"Taking-Place: Non-Representational Theories and Geography","title-short":"Taking-Place","type":"book"},

Towards this end, we consider coordination games where agents have different intrinsic preferences but they stand to gain if others choose the same strategy as them. For non-trivial versions of our game, stable solutions like Nash Equilibrium may not exist, or may be socially inefficient even when they do exist. This motivates us to focus on designing efficient algorithms to compute (almost) stable solutions like Approximate Equilibrium that can be realized if agents are provided some additional incentives. Our results apply in many settings like adoption of new products, project selection, and group formation, where a central authority can direct agents towards a strategy but agents may defect if they have better alternatives. We show that for any given instance, we can either compute a high quality approximate equilibrium or a near-optimal solution that can be stabilized by providing small payments to some players. We then generalize our model to encompass situations where player relationships may exhibit complementarities and present an algorithm to compute an Approximate Equilibrium whose stability factor is linear in the degree of complementarity. Our results imply that a little influence is necessary in order to ensure that selfish players coordinate and form socially efficient solutions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",5,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Anshelevich","given":"Elliot"},{"family":"Sekar","given":"Shreyas"}],"citation-key":"anshelevich2014","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.1404.4718","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",4,18]]},"number":"arXiv:1404.4718","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Approximate Equilibrium and Incentivizing Social Coordination","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.4718"},
  {"id":"anton2014","abstract":"Background\n              \n                Until recently, the evolution of the genus\n                Homo\n                has been interpreted in the context of the onset of African aridity and the expansion of open grasslands.\n                Homo erectus\n                was considered to be a bona fide member of the genus\n                Homo\n                , but opinions diverged on the generic status of earlier, more fragmentary fossils traditionally attributed to\n                Homo habilis\n                and\n                Homo rudolfensis\n                . Arguments about generic status of these taxa rested on inferred similarities and differences in adaptive plateau. However, there was near-universal agreement that the open-country suite of features inferred for\n                Homo erectus\n                had evolved together and provided the adaptations for dispersal beyond Africa. These features foreshadowed those of more recent\n                Homo sapiens\n                and included large, linear bodies, elongated legs, large brain sizes, reduced sexual dimorphism, increased carnivory, and unique life history traits (e.g., extended ontogeny and longevity) as well as toolmaking and increased social cooperation.\n              \n            \n            \n              Advances\n              \n                Over the past decade, new fossil discoveries and new lines of interpretation have substantially altered this interpretation. New environmental data sets suggest that\n                Homo\n                evolved against a background of long periods of habitat unpredictability that were superimposed on the underlying aridity trend. New fossils support the presence of multiple groups of early\n                Homo\n                that overlap in body, brain, and tooth size and challenge the traditional interpretation of\n                H. habilis\n                and\n                H. rudolfensis\n                as representing small and large morphs, respectively. Because of a fragmentary and distorted type specimen for\n                H. habilis\n                two informal morphs are proposed, the 1813 group and the 1470 group, that are distinguished on the basis of facial anatomy but do not contain the same constituent fossils as the more formally designated species of early\n                Homo\n                . Furthermore, traits once thought to define early\n                Homo\n                , particularly\n                H. erectus\n                , did not arise as a single package. Some features once considered characteristic of\n                Homo\n                are found in\n                Australopithecus\n                (e.g., long hind limbs), whereas others do not occur until much later in time (e.g., narrow pelves and extended ontogeny). When integrated with our understanding of the biology of living humans and other mammals, the fossil and archaeological record of early\n                Homo\n                suggests that key factors to the success and expansion of the genus rested on dietary flexibility in unpredictable environments, which, along with cooperative breeding and flexibility in development, allowed range expansion and reduced mortality risks.\n              \n            \n            \n              Outlook\n              \n                Although more fossils and archaeological finds will continue to enhance our understanding of the evolution of early\n                Homo\n                , the comparative biology of mammals (including humans) will continue to provide valuable frameworks for the interpretation of existing material. This comparative context enables us to formulate and test robust models of the relationships between energetics, life history, brain and body size, diet, mortality, and resource variability and thereby yield a deeper understanding of human evolution.\n              \n            \n          , \n            Pleistocene people and environments\n            \n              In the past few decades, hundreds of hominin fossils have been recovered from well-dated sites in East Africa. In addition, early representatives from far outside Africa have been found in Asia and Europe. Recently, discoveries at Malapa in South Africa and at Dmanisi in western Asia have brought important new fossils and archaeological residues to light. Analyses of local stratigraphy, windblown dust, sea and lake cores, and stable isotopic analyses have improved the reconstruction of ancient environments inhabited by early humans.

Many features associated with\n              Homo sapiens\n              , including our large linear bodies, elongated hind limbs, large energy-expensive brains, reduced sexual dimorphism, increased carnivory, and unique life history traits, were once thought to have evolved near the origin of the genus in response to heightened aridity and open habitats in Africa. However, recent analyses of fossil, archaeological, and environmental data indicate that such traits did not arise as a single package. Instead, some arose substantially earlier and some later than previously thought. From ~2.5 to 1.5 million years ago, three lineages of early\n              Homo\n              evolved in a context of habitat instability and fragmentation on seasonal, intergenerational, and evolutionary time scales.

In a correlated equilibrium, players rationally condition their strategies on realizations of a common external randomization device and, as a consequence, can achieve payoffs that Pareto dominate any of the game's Nash equilibria. In this paper we explore whether such correlated equilibria can be learned over time using an evolutionary learning model where agents do not start with any knowledge of the distribution of random draws made by the external randomization device. Furthermore, we validate our learning algorithm findings by comparing the end behavior of simulations of our algorithm with both the correlated equilibrium of the game and the behavior of human subjects that play that same game. Our results suggest that the evolutionary learning model is capable of learning the correlated equilibria of these games in a manner that approximates well the learning behavior of human subjects and that our findings are robust to changes in the specification and parameterization of the model.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Arifovic","given":"Jasmina"},{"family":"Boitnott","given":"Joshua F."},{"family":"Duffy","given":"John"}],"citation-key":"arifovic2019","container-title":"Journal of Economic Behavior & Organization","container-title-short":"Journal of Economic Behavior & Organization","DOI":"10.1016/j.jebo.2016.09.011","ISSN":"0167-2681","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"171-190","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Learning correlated equilibria: An evolutionary approach","title-short":"Learning correlated equilibria","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167268116302025","volume":"157"},

More generally, I argue that evolutionary theory provides good reasons for maintaining that minded communication is both temporally and explanatorily prior to the use of communicative intentions. After developing these negative points about the place of communicative intentions in detail, I provide a novel alternative account according to which minded communication is characterized in terms of patterns of action and response that function to coordinate the representational mental states of agents.

  {"id":"badcock2019","abstract":"The purpose of this review was to integrate leading paradigms in psychology and neuroscience with a theory of the embodied, situated human brain, called the Hierarchically Mechanistic Mind (HMM). The HMM describes the brain as a complex adaptive system that functions to minimize the entropy of our sensory and physical states via action-perception cycles generated by hierarchical neural dynamics. First, we review the extant literature on the hierarchical structure of the brain. Next, we derive the HMM from a broader evolutionary systems theory that explains neural structure and function in terms of dynamic interactions across four nested levels of biological causation (i.e., adaptation, phylogeny, ontogeny, and mechanism). We then describe how the HMM aligns with a global brain theory in neuroscience called the free-energy principle, leveraging this theory to mathematically formulate neural dynamics across hierarchical spatiotemporal scales. We conclude by exploring the implications of the HMM for psychological inquiry.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",7,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Badcock","given":"Paul B."},{"family":"Friston","given":"Karl J."},{"family":"Ramstead","given":"Maxwell J.

The negative argument is against the use of the term ‘social affordance’, a term that confuses the perspective of the researcher with that of the animal. Instead, it is advocated that we adopt, as a working hypothesis, the claim that all affordances are social; that is, all affordances are public and are, in principle, observable by a third party. The programmatic outline then shows that affordances alone are insufficient for describing social meaning.

  {"id":"bar-on2021","abstract":"Recent discussions of animal communication and the evolution of language have advocated adopting a ‘pragmatics-first’ approach, according to which “a more productive framework” for primate communication research should be “pragmatics, the field of linguistics that examines the role of context in shaping the meaning of linguistic utterances” (Wheeler and Fischer, Evol Anthropol 21:195–205, 2012: 203). After distinguishing two different conceptions of pragmatics that advocates of the pragmatics-first approach have implicitly relied on (one Carnapian, the other Gricean), I argue that neither conception adequately serves the purposes of pragmatics-first approaches to the origins of human linguistic communication. My main aim in this paper is to motivate–and begin to articulate–an intermediary conception whose scope is narrower than Carnapian pragmatics but broader than Gricean pragmatics. To do so, I first spell out what I take to be the key insight offered by proponents of the Gricean approach concerning the emergence of linguistic communication, namely, its being communication ‘from a psychological point of view’ (Tomasello, Origins of human communication, MIT Press, Cambridge MA, 2008). I then develop this insight using key elements from the anti-Gricean ‘biosemantic’ account of linguistic communication due to Ruth Millikan (Millikan, Language, thought, and other biological categories: New foundations for realism, MIT Press, Cambridge MA, 1984, Millikan, Tomberlin (ed), Philosophical Perspectives 9, Ridgeview Publishing, Atascedero CA, 1995, Millikan R (2006) Varieties of Meaning. Mass.: The MIT Press (paperback edition), Cambridge, Millikan, Beyond concepts: unicepts, language, and natural information, Oxford University Press, Oxford UK, 2017, and elsewhere). I argue that the intermediary pragmatics-first approach that I propose, which draws on both Gricean and Millikanian resources, would be better equipped to serve the purposes of those who search for potential precursors of human linguistic communication in animal communication.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Bar-On","given":"Dorit"}],"citation-key":"bar-on2021","container-title":"Biology & Philosophy","container-title-short":"Biol Philos","DOI":"10.1007/s10539-021-09824-z","ISSN":"1572-8404","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",11,2]]},"language":"en","page":"50","source":"Springer Link","title":"How to do things with nonwords: pragmatics, biosemantics, and origins of language in animal communication","title-short":"How to do things with nonwords","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10539-021-09824-z","volume":"36"},
  {"id":"barad2007","abstract":"Meeting the Universe Halfway is an ambitious book with far-reaching implications for numerous fields in the natural sciences, social sciences, and humanities. In this volume, Karen Barad, theoretical physicist and feminist theorist, elaborates her theory of agential realism. Offering an account of the world as a whole rather than as composed of separate natural and social realms, agential realism is at once a new epistemology, ontology, and ethics. The starting point for Barad’s analysis is the philosophical framework of quantum physicist Niels Bohr. Barad extends and partially revises Bohr’s philosophical views in light of current scholarship in physics, science studies, and the philosophy of science as well as feminist, poststructuralist, and other critical social theories. In the process, she significantly reworks understandings of space, time, matter, causality, agency, subjectivity, and objectivity.In an agential realist account, the world is made of entanglements of “social” and “natural” agencies, where the distinction between the two emerges out of specific intra-actions. Intra-activity is an inexhaustible dynamism that configures and reconfigures relations of space-time-matter. In explaining intra-activity, Barad reveals questions about how nature and culture interact and change over time to be fundamentally misguided. And she reframes understanding of the nature of scientific and political practices and their “interrelationship.” Thus she pays particular attention to the responsible practice of science, and she emphasizes changes in the understanding of political practices, critically reworking Judith Butler’s influential theory of performativity. Finally, Barad uses agential realism to produce a new interpretation of quantum physics, demonstrating that agential realism is more than a means of reflecting on science; it can be used to actually do science.","author":[{"family":"Barad","given":"Karen"}],"citation-key":"barad2007","ISBN":"978-0-8223-8812-8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007",7,11]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"542","publisher":"Duke University Press","source":"Google Books","title":"Meeting the Universe Halfway: Quantum Physics and the Entanglement of Matter and Meaning","title-short":"Meeting the Universe Halfway","type":"book"},
  {"id":"baraghith2019","abstract":"The generalized theory of evolution suggests that evolutionary algorithms apply to biological and cultural processes like language alike. Variation, selection and reproduction constitute abstract and formal traits of complex, open and often self-regulating systems. Accepting this basic assumption provides us with a powerful background methodology for this investigation: explaining the emergence and proliferation of semantic patterns, that become conventional. A teleosemantic theory of public (conventional) meaning (Millikan 1984; 2005) grounded in a generalized theory of evolution explains the proliferation of public language forms in terms of their adaptive proper function. It has also been suggested, that the emergence of meaning, can be formalized with game-theoretical tools (Skyrms 2010) within signaling systems of coordination. I want to show how closely related these approaches are, both in terms of explanandum and of outcomes. To put it in a nutshell: If the emergence of public meaning can be satisfyingly explained in terms of signaling games, then the cultural evolutionary dynamics will serve as an adequate model to describe their proliferation. Public or conventional meaning (in contrast to personal meaning) can be fully understood in terms of its evolutionary function in a population of communicators. Furthermore, I want to argue how this understanding of conventional meaning could lead us to a strong semantic holism.","author":[{"family":"Baraghith","given":"Karim"}],"citation-key":"baraghith2019","container-title":"Journal of Philosophy","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"language":"en","page":"30","source":"Zotero","title":"Emergence of Public Meaning from a Teleosemantic and Game Theoretical Perspective","type":"article-journal"},

Dynamical independence instantiates the intuition of an emergent macroscopic process as one possessing the characteristics of a dynamical system \"in its own right\", with its own dynamical laws distinct from those of the underlying microscopic dynamics. We quantify (departure from) dynamical independence by a transformation-invariant Shannon information-based measure of dynamical dependence. We emphasise the data-driven discovery of dynamically-independent macroscopic variables, and introduce the idea of a multiscale \"emergence portrait\" for complex systems. We show how dynamical dependence may be computed explicitly for linear systems via state-space modelling, in both time and frequency domains, facilitating discovery of emergent phenomena at all spatiotemporal scales. We discuss application of the state-space operationalisation to inference of the emergence portrait for neural systems from neurophysiological time-series data.

  {"id":"barsalou2005","abstract":"Two themes about the conceptual system are developed: (1) modal simulations underlie conceptual processing; (2) conceptual representations are situated. The construct of situated conceptualization-a multimodal simulation that supports one specific course of situated action with a particular category instance-integrates these themes. A given concept produces many different situated conceptualizations, each tailored to different instances in different settings. A situated conceptualization creates the experience of “being there” with a category instance in a setting via integrated simulations of objects, settings, actions, and introspections. On recognizing a familiar type of instance, an entrenched situated conceptualization associated with it becomes active, which provides relevant inferences via pattern completion.

Our framework rests on two primary assumptions: (1) agents play ensembles of games, not just single games as is traditionally the case in evolutionary game theory models; and (2) agents have finite cognitive capacity. Our analysis combines agent-based techniques and mathematics, enabling us to explore dynamics and to prove when the behaviors produced by the agents are equilibria.

It argues that during the late Middle Ages and in the Early Modern era, philosophers began to disentangle substantial actions from the nature of substances.

  {"id":"benerink2018","abstract":"In many daily situations, our behavior is coordinated with that of others. This study investigated this coordination in a doubles-pong task. In this task, two participants each controlled a paddle that could move laterally near the bottom of a shared computer screen. With their paddles, the players needed to block balls that moved down under an angle. In doing so, they needed to make sure that their paddles did not collide. A successful interception led to the ball bouncing back upwards. Importantly, all communication other than through vision of the shared screen was excluded. In the experiment, the initial position of the paddle of the right player was varied across trials. This allowed testing hypotheses regarding the use of a tacitly understood boundary to divide interception space. This boundary could be halfway the screen, or in the middle between the initial positions of the two paddles. These two hypotheses did not hold. As an alternative to planned division of labor, the behavioral patterns might emerge from continuous visual couplings of paddles and ball. This was tested with an action-based decision model that considered the rates of change of each player’s angle between the interception axis and the line connecting the ball and inner edge of the paddle. The model accounted for the observed patterns of behavior to a very large extent. This led to the conclusion that decisions of who would take the ball emerged from ongoing social coordination. Implications for social coordination in general are discussed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Benerink","given":"Niek H."},{"family":"Zaal","given":"Frank T.J.M."},{"family":"Casanova","given":"Remy"},{"family":"Bonnardel","given":"Nathalie"},{"family":"Bootsma","given":"Reinoud J."}],"citation-key":"benerink2018","container-title":"Human Movement Science","container-title-short":"Human Movement Science","DOI":"10.1016/j.humov.2017.11.012","ISSN":"01679457","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",2]]},"language":"en","page":"134-148","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Division of labor as an emergent phenomenon of social coordination: The example of playing doubles-pong","title-short":"Division of labor as an emergent phenomenon of social coordination","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0167945717304608","volume":"57"},

The focus is on the central issue of the economy of research in abduction and self-correction by error reduction in induction. We show how Peirce’s logic of science receives support from modern breakthroughs in computational neuroscience, and more specifically from Karl Friston’s statements of active inference and the Free Energy Principle, namely the account of how organisms’ capacity to decrease the discrepancy between the expected value and actual outcomes entails the minimisation of errors in their hypotheses about the world. A scientific account of organisms’ capacity to choose policies and form expectations is aligned with Peirce’s theories of abduction and induction, and especially with the economy of research.

  {"id":"bicchieri2018a","abstract":"Social norms, the informal rules that govern behavior in groups andsocieties, have been extensively studied in the social sciences.Anthropologists have described how social norms function in differentcultures (Geertz 1973), sociologists have focused on their socialfunctions and how they motivate people to act (Durkheim 1895 [1982],1950 [1957]; Parsons 1937; Parsons & Shils 1951; James Coleman1990; Hechter & Opp 2001), and economists have explored howadherence to norms influences market behavior (Akerlof 1976; Young1998a). More recently, also legal scholars have touted social norms asefficient alternatives to legal rules, as they may internalizenegative externalities and provide signaling mechanisms at little orno cost (Ellickson 1991; Posner 2000)., With a few exceptions, the social science literature conceives ofnorms as exogenous variables. Since norms are mainly seen asconstraining behavior, some of the key differences between moral,social, and legal norms—as well as differences between norms andconventions—have been blurred. Much attention has instead beenpaid to the conditions under which norms will be obeyed. Because ofthat, the issue of sanctions has been paramount in the socialscience literature. Moreover, since social norms are seen as centralto the production of social order or social coordination, research onnorms has been focused on the functions they perform. Yeteven if a norm may fulfill important social functions (such as welfaremaximization or the elimination of externalities), it cannot beexplained solely on the basis of the functions it performs. Thesimplistic functionalist perspective has been rejected on severalaccounts; in fact, even though a given norm can be conceived as ameans to achieve some goal, this is usually not the reason why itemerged in the first place (Elster 1989a, 1989b). Moreover, although aparticular norm may persist (as opposed to emerge) because of somepositive social function it fulfills, there are many others that areinefficient and even widely unpopular., Philosophers have taken a different approach to norms. In theliterature on norms and conventions, both social constructs are seenas the endogenous product of individuals’ interactions (Lewis1969; Ullmann-Margalit 1977; Vandershraaf 1995; Bicchieri 2006). Normsare represented as equilibria of games of strategy, and as such theyare supported by a cluster of self-fulfilling expectations. Beliefs,expectations, group knowledge and common knowledge have thus becomecentral concepts in the development of a philosophical view of socialnorms. Paying attention to the role played by expectations insupporting social norms has helped differentiate between social norms,conventions, and descriptive norms: an important distinction oftenoverlooked in the social science accounts, but crucial when we need todiagnose the nature of a pattern of behavior in order to intervene onit.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",11,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Bicchieri","given":"Cristina"},{"family":"Muldoon","given":"Ryan"},{"family":"Sontuoso","given":"Alessandro"}],"citation-key":"bicchieri2018a","container-title":"The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy","edition":"Winter 2018","editor":[{"family":"Zalta","given":"Edward N."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"publisher":"Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University","source":"Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy","title":"Social Norms","type":"chapter","URL":"https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2018/entries/social-norms/"},

The re-appraisal continues to defend a version of the Rawlsian position against Harsanyi’s utilitarian alternative, but no longer makes the error of emphasizing technical matters from the theory of non-cooperative bargaining models. It is necessary that the right ideas be borrowed from this theory, but the crucial issue is that “commitment” be properly modeled. The bulk of the paper is concerned with justifying the manner in which the term “properly modeled” is to be interpreted. The treatment forces close attention to be given to questions of the inter-personal comparison of utilities. This treatment may be of some independent interest, since it leads to some unifying considerations for cooperative bargaining solutions.

This paper explores the extent to which his approach finds support in the game theory literature. The knowledge formalism developed by Robert Aumann and others militates against Lewis’s approach, because it shows that it is almost impossible for something to become common knowledge in a large society.

Maurice Bloch argues for a naturalist approach to social and cultural anthropology, introducing developments in cognitive sciences such as psychology and neurology and exploring the relevance of these developments for central anthropological concerns: the person or the self, cosmology, kinship, memory and globalisation. Opening with an exploration of the history of anthropology, Bloch shows why and how naturalist approaches were abandoned and argues that these once valid reasons are no longer relevant. Bloch then shows how such subjects as the self, memory and the conceptualisation of time benefit from being simultaneously approached with the tools of social and cognitive science.

  {"id":"bohn2022","abstract":"A computational model is introduced that formalizes great ape communication as a multi-faceted social inference process that integrates information contained in the signals that make up an utterance, the relationship between communicative partners and the social context. Human communication has been described as a contextual social inference process. Research into great ape communication has been inspired by this view to look for the evolutionary roots of the social, cognitive and interactional processes involved in human communication. This approach has been highly productive, yet it is partly compromised by the widespread focus on how great apes use and understand individual signals. This paper introduces a computational model that formalizes great ape communication as a multi-faceted social inference process that integrates (a) information contained in the signals that make up an utterance, (b) the relationship between communicative partners and (c) the social context. This model makes accurate qualitative and quantitative predictions about real-world communicative interactions between semi-wild-living chimpanzees. When enriched with a pragmatic reasoning process, the model explains repeatedly reported differences between humans and great apes in the interpretation of ambiguous signals (e.g. pointing or iconic gestures). This approach has direct implications for observational and experimental studies of great ape communication and provides a new tool for theorizing about the evolution of uniquely human communication.

  {"id":"bonawitz2011","abstract":"Motivated by computational analyses, we look at how teaching affects exploration and discovery. In Experiment 1, we investigated children’s exploratory play after an adult pedagogically demonstrated a function of a toy, after an interrupted pedagogical demonstration, after a naïve adult demonstrated the function, and at baseline. Preschoolers in the pedagogical condition focused almost exclusively on the target function; by contrast, children in the other conditions explored broadly. In Experiment 2, we show that children restrict their exploration both after direct instruction to themselves and after overhearing direct instruction given to another child; they do not show this constraint after observing direct instruction given to an adult or after observing a non-pedagogical intentional action. We discuss these findings as the result of rational inductive biases. In pedagogical contexts, a teacher’s failure to provide evidence for additional functions provides evidence for their absence; such contexts generalize from child to child (because children are likely to have comparable states of knowledge) but not from adult to child. Thus, pedagogy promotes efficient learning but at a cost: children are less likely to perform potentially irrelevant actions but also less likely to discover novel information.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Bonawitz","given":"Elizabeth"},{"family":"Shafto","given":"Patrick"},{"family":"Gweon","given":"Hyowon"},{"family":"Goodman","given":"Noah D."},{"family":"Spelke","given":"Elizabeth"},{"family":"Schulz","given":"Laura"}],"citation-key":"bonawitz2011","collection-title":"Probabilistic models of cognitive development","container-title":"Cognition","container-title-short":"Cognition","DOI":"10.1016/j.cognition.2010.10.001","ISSN":"0010-0277","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",9,1]]},"page":"322-330","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"The double-edged sword of pedagogy: Instruction limits spontaneous exploration and discovery","title-short":"The double-edged sword of pedagogy","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027710002258","volume":"120"},

We use a standard extended fitness accounting framework to identify the parameter space for which this co-evolutionary process generates high levels of group-beneficial behaviors. We show that intergroup conflicts may explain the evolutionary success of both: (a) altruistic forms of human sociality towards unrelated members of one's group; and (b) group-level institutional structures such as food sharing which have emerged and diffused repeatedly in a wide variety of ecologies during the course of human history. Group-beneficial behaviors may evolve if (a) they inflict sufficient fitness costs on outgroup individuals and (b) group-level institutions limit the individual fitness costs of these behaviors and thereby attenuate within-group selection against these behaviors. Thus, the evolutionary success of individually costly but group-beneficial behaviors in the relevant environments during the first 90,000 years of anatomically modern human existence may have been a consequence of distinctive human capacities in social institution building.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Bowles","given":"Samuel"},{"family":"Choi","given":"Jung-Kyoo"},{"family":"Hopfensitz","given":"Astrid"}],"citation-key":"bowles2003","container-title":"Journal of Theoretical Biology","container-title-short":"Journal of Theoretical Biology","DOI":"10.1016/S0022-5193(03)00060-2","ISSN":"0022-5193","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2003",7,21]]},"language":"en","page":"135-147","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"The co-evolution of individual behaviors and social institutions","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519303000602","volume":"223"},

As the audience size grows, interlocuters face new challenges that do not arise in dyads. They must consider multiple perspectives and weigh multiple sources of feedback to build shared understanding. Here, we ask which properties of the group’s interaction structure facilitate successful communication. We used a repeated reference game paradigm in which directors instructed between one and five matchers to choose specific targets out of a set of abstract figures. Across 313 games (𝑁 = 1, 319 participants), we manipulated several key constraints on the group’s interaction, including the amount of feedback that matchers could give to directors and the availability of peer interaction between matchers. Across groups of different sizes and interaction constraints, describers produced increasingly efficient utterances and matchers made increasingly accurate selections. Critically, however, we found that smaller groups and groups with less-constrained interaction structures (“thick channels”) showed stronger convergence to group-specific conventions than large groups with constrained interaction structures (“thin channels”), which struggled with convention formation. Overall, these results shed new light on the core structural factors that enable communication to thrive in larger groups.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Boyce","given":"Veronica"},{"family":"Hawkins","given":"Robert"},{"family":"Goodman","given":"Noah D."},{"family":"Frank","given":"Michael C."}],"citation-key":"boyce2024","DOI":"10.31234/osf.io/a3wfy","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,7]]},"language":"en","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode","source":"PsyArXiv","title":"Interaction structure constrains the emergence of conventions in group communication","type":"article","URL":"https://osf.io/a3wfy"},

Here we suggest that these features are best explained as the outcome of evolved human cognition, in such domains as mating, moral judgment and social exchange. As empirical illustrations, we show how this evolved psychology makes marriage systems, legal norms and commons management systems intuitively obvious and compelling, thereby ensuring their occurrence and cultural stability. We extend this to propose under what conditions institutions can become ‘natural’, compelling and legitimate, and outline probable paths for institutional change given human cognitive dispositions. Explaining institutions in terms of these exogenous factors also suggests that a general theory of institutions as such is neither necessary nor in fact possible.

This adaptation allows for message of arbitrary length and is less likely to get caught in a pooling equilibrium than existing models do. The second model is an artificial neural network approach. In this model it is more likely that a signalling strategy with perfect information transfer emerges and the agents can communicate about states that are not trained but are similar to the states that are known.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Brinkhorst","given":"Sanne"}],"citation-key":"brinkhorst2014","genre":"Report","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",11,6]]},"language":"en","source":"eprints.illc.uva.nl","title":"On Evolution of Compositionality","type":"report","URL":"https://eprints.illc.uva.nl/id/eprint/935/"},
  {"id":"brod2023","abstract":"Advancing learners’ agency is a key educational goal. The advent of personalized EdTech, which automatically tailor learning environments to individual learners, gives renewed relevance to the topic. EdTech researchers and practitioners are confronted with the same basic question: What is the right amount of agency to give to learners during their interactions with EdTech? This question is even more relevant for younger learners. Our aim in this paper is twofold: First, we outline and synthesize the ways in which agency is conceptualized in three key learning disciplines (philosophy, education, and psychology). We show that there are different types and levels of agency and various prerequisites for the effective exercise of agency and that these undergo developmental change. Second, we provide guiding principles for how agency can be designed for in EdTech for children. We propose an agency personalization loop in which the level of agency provided by the EdTech is assigned in an adaptive manner to strike a balance between allowing children to freely choose learning content and assigning optimal content to them. Finally, we highlight some examples from practice.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Brod","given":"Garvin"},{"family":"Kucirkova","given":"Natalia"},{"family":"Shepherd","given":"Joshua"},{"family":"Jolles","given":"Dietsje"},{"family":"Molenaar","given":"Inge"}],"citation-key":"brod2023","container-title":"Educational Psychology Review","container-title-short":"Educ Psychol Rev","DOI":"10.1007/s10648-023-09749-x","ISSN":"1573-336X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,28]]},"language":"en","page":"25","source":"Springer Link","title":"Agency in Educational Technology: Interdisciplinary Perspectives and Implications for Learning Design","title-short":"Agency in Educational Technology","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10648-023-09749-x","volume":"35"},
  {"id":"bronzo","abstract":"It is almost universally accepted that the Frege–Geach Point is necessary for explaining the inferential relations and compositional structure of truth-functionally complex propositions. I argue that this claim rests on a disputable view of propositional structure, which models truth-functionally complex propositions on atomic propositions. I propose an alternative view of propositional structure, based on a certain notion of <em>simulation</em>, which accounts for the relevant phenomena without accepting the Frege–Geach Point. The main contention is that truth-functionally complex propositions do not include as their parts truth-evaluable propositions, but their simulations, which are neither forceful nor truth-evaluable. The view makes room for the idea that there is no such thing as the forceless expression of propositional contents and is attractive because it provides the resources for avoiding a fundamental problem generated by the Frege–Geach Point concerning the relation between forceless and forceful expressions of propositional contents. I further argue that the acceptance of the Frege–Geach Point mars Peter Hanks' and François Recanati's recent attempts to resist the widespread idea that assertoric force is extrinsic to the expression of propositional contents. Rejecting this idea, I maintain, requires a deeper break with the tradition than Hanks and Recanati have allowed for.","author":[{"family":"Bronzo","given":"Silver"}],"citation-key":"bronzo","container-title":"Synthese","DOI":"10.1007/s11229-019-02270-1","title":"Propositional complexity and the Frege–Geach Point","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11229-019-02270-1?utm_source=researcher_app&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=RESR_MRKT_Researcher_inbound"},

As a starting point we consider the signaling game introduced by Lewis (Convention 1969). We find that in experimental settings, small groups can quickly develop conventions of signal meaning in these games. We also investigate versions of the game where the theoretical literature indicates that meaning will be less likely to arise—when there are more than two states for actors to transfer meaning about and when some states are more likely than others. In these cases, we find that actors are less likely to arrive at strategies where signals have clear conventional meaning.

Great apes possess many of the cognitive prerequisites for language, but largely lack the motivation to share information. Callitrichids (including marmosets and tamarins) are highly vocal monkeys that are more distantly related to humans than great apes are, but like humans, they are cooperative breeders and all group members help raising offspring. Among primates, this rearing system is correlated with proactive prosociality, which can be expressed as motivation to share information. We therefore propose that the unique coincidence of these two components in humans set the stage for language evolution: The cognitive component inherited from our great ape-like ancestors, and the motivational one added convergently as a result of cooperative breeding. We evaluate this scenario based on a review of callitrichd vocal communication and show that furthermore, they possess many of the mechanistic elements emphasized by the mirror system hypothesis of language evolution.

These contexts, are characterized by emergent self-organization that implies higher order coordinated patterns occurring over time that are not due to the actions of any particular agents, but rather due to the collective ordering that occurs from the interactions of the agents. Extant research to understand these social coordination dynamics (SCD) has primarily examined dyadic contexts performing rhythmic tasks. To advance this area of study, we elaborate on attractor dynamics, our ability to depict them visually, and quantitatively model them. Primarily, we combine difference/differential equation modeling with mixture modeling as a way to infer the underlying topological features of the data, which can be described in terms of attractor dynamic patterns. The advantage of this approach is that we are able to quantify the self-organized dynamics that agents exhibit, link these dynamics back to activity from individual agents, and relate it to other variables central to understanding the coordinative functionality of a system's behavior. We present four examples that differ in the number of variables used to depict the attractor dynamics (1, 2, and 6) and range from simulated to non-simulated data sources. We demonstrate that this is a flexible method that advances scientific study of SCD in a variety of multi-agent systems. © 2017 Butner, Wiltshire and Munion.","archive":"Scopus","author":[{"family":"Butner","given":"J.E."},{"family":"Wiltshire","given":"T.J."},{"family":"Munion","given":"A.K."}],"citation-key":"butner2017","container-title":"Frontiers in Psychology","DOI":"10.3389/fpsyg.2017.00380","ISSN":"1664-1078","issue":"MAR","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"source":"Scopus","title":"Modeling multi-agent self-organization through the lens of higher order attractor dynamics","type":"article-journal","volume":"8"},

  {"id":"caporael2007","abstract":"Humans are a fundamentally social species. Our evolution is a product of the coevolution of genetic endowment, social structure, and culture. The dominant metaphor in the human sciences, \"selfish gene theory\" (Dawkins, 1976) or the \"gene's-eye view\" of evolution, has limited resources to theorize groups and the consequences of group living for the human mind. This chapter draws on multilevel selection theory, which offers a framework more appropriate than genes for psychological levels of analysis. An expanded evolutionary theory has a crucial advantage in the human sciences: It enables us to point at recurrence without getting embroiled in nature-nurture controversies. I propose a model of core configurations in face-to-face groups as the selective environment of uniquely human mental systems and the reorganization of earlier evolved \"building blocks.\" If the model is valid, we should expect human mental systems to correlate with core configurations. We should also expect that capabilities specialized for specific configurations can be extended and recombined for novel behavior and situations, including life in the modern world. The model rejects the traditional reductionist view of biology as the basis for psychology, which in turn is the basis for culture.

  {"id":"carter","abstract":"This paper is about two topics: metaepistemological absolutism and the epistemic principles governing perceptual warrant. Our aim is to highlight—by taking the debate between dogmatists and conservativists about perceptual warrant as a case study—a surprising and hitherto unnoticed problem with metaepistemological absolutism, at least as it has been influentially defended by Paul Boghossian (Fear of knowledge: against relativism and constructivism, Oxford University Press, Oxford, <span class=\"CitationRef\"><a href=\"#CR3\">2006a</a></span>) as the principal metaepistemological contrast point to relativism. What we find is that the metaepistemological commitments at play on both sides of this dogmatism/conservativism debate do not line up with epistemic relativism <em class=\"EmphasisTypeItalic\">nor</em> do they line up with absolutism, at least as Boghossian articulates this position. What this case study reveals is the need in metaepistemological option space for the recognition of a weaker and less tendentious form of absolutism, what we call \"environment relativism\". On this view, epistemic principles are knowable, objective, and they can serve as the basis of particular epistemic evaluations, but their validity is relative to the wider global environment in which they are applied.","author":[{"family":"Carter","given":"J.

We consider a model of incomplete information in which each player receives a signal, interpreted as an allocation to a role, and can make his action choice conditional on his role. Our main result demonstrates that 'near to' any correlated equilibrium is an approximate correlated equilibrium 'with conformity' -- that is, an equilibrium where all 'similar players' play the same strategy, have the same probability of being allocated to each role, and receive approximately the same payoff; in short, similar players 'behave in an identical way' and are treated nearly equally. To measure 'similarity' amongst players we introduce the notions of approximate substitutes and a (delta,Q)-class games -- a game with Q classes of players where all players in the same class are delta-substitutes for each other.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Cartwright","given":"Edward"},{"family":"Wooders","given":"Myrna"}],"citation-key":"cartwright2005","genre":"Working Paper","issued":{"date-parts":[["2005"]]},"language":"en_US","note":"Accepted: 2020-09-13T21:32:30Z","publisher":"Vanderbilt University","source":"ir.vanderbilt.edu","title":"Correlated Equilibrium and Behavioral Conformity","type":"report","URL":"https://ir.vanderbilt.edu/handle/1803/15787"},

The vase is in the box; hence the box is not in the vase. But what does it mean for an object to be somewhere? How are objects tied to the space they occupy? In this book Roberto Casati and Achille C. Varzi address some of the fundamental issues in the philosophy of spatial representation. Their starting point is an analysis of the interplay between mereology (the study of part/whole relations), topology (the study of spatial continuity and compactness), and the theory of spatial location proper. This leads to a unified framework for spatial representation understood quite broadly as a theory of the representation of spatial entities. The framework is then tested against some classical metaphysical questions such as: Are parts essential to their wholes? Is spatial co-location a sufficient criterion of identity? What (if anything) distinguishes material objects from events and other spatial entities? The concluding chapters deal with applications to topics as diverse as the logical analysis of movement and the semantics of maps.","author":[{"family":"Casati","given":"Roberto"},{"family":"Varzi","given":"Achille C."},{"family":"Varzi","given":"Assistant Professor of Philosophy Achille C."}],"citation-key":"casati1999","ISBN":"978-0-262-03266-7","issued":{"date-parts":[["1999"]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"258","publisher":"MIT Press","source":"Google Books","title":"Parts and Places: The Structures of Spatial Representation","title-short":"Parts and Places","type":"book"},

  {"id":"cecchinimanara2020","abstract":"This work aims at ﬁlling a gap in the cognitive representation of institutions, starting from Aoki’s account of institutions as equilibria in a gametheoretical framework. We propose a formal model to explain what happens when different players hold different representations of the game they are playing. In particular, we assume that agents do not know all the feasible strategies they can play, because they have bounded rationality; grounding on the works by Johnson-Laird and his coauthors, we suggest that individuals use parsimonious mental models that make as little as possible explicit to represent the game they are playing, because of their limited capacity of working memory and attention. Second, we rely on Bacharach’s variable frame theory: agents transform the objective game into a framed game, where strategies are “labeled” in some sense. In such a context, we argue that a social contract – given its prescriptive and universalizable meaning – may provide a shared mental model, accepted by all players, that allows agents to select a joint plan of action corresponding to an efﬁcient and fair distribution.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Cecchini Manara","given":"Virginia"},{"family":"Sacconi","given":"Lorenzo"}],"citation-key":"cecchinimanara2020","container-title":"SSRN Electronic Journal","container-title-short":"SSRN Journal","DOI":"10.2139/ssrn.3693323","ISSN":"1556-5068","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"language":"en","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Institutions, Frames, and Social Contract Reasoning","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ssrn.com/abstract=3693323"},

When minority groups reached the critical mass-that is, the critical group size for initiating social change-they were consistently able to overturn the established behavior. The size of the required critical mass is expected to vary based on theoretically identifiable features of a social setting.

The thermodynamic free-energy (FE) principle describes an organism's homeostasis as the regulation of biochemical work constrained by the physical FE cost. By contrast, recent research in neuroscience and theoretical biology explains a higher organism's homeostasis and allostasis as Bayesian inference facilitated by the informational FE. As an integrated approach to living systems, this study presents an FE minimization theory overarching the essential features of both the thermodynamic and neuroscientific FE principles. Our results reveal that the perception and action of animals result from active inference entailed by FE minimization in the brain, and the brain operates as a Schrödinger's machine conducting the neural mechanics of minimizing sensory uncertainty. A parsimonious model suggests that the Bayesian brain develops the optimal trajectories in neural manifolds and induces a dynamic bifurcation between neural attractors in the process of active inference.","author":[{"literal":"Chang Sub Kim"}],"citation-key":"changsubkim2023","DOI":"10.1098/rsfs.2022.0041","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,14]]},"note":"MAG ID: 4365514983","PMID":"37065269","title":"🔥 Free energy and inference in living systems","type":"article-journal","volume":"13"},

In Experiment 1, we show that teachers select examples that account for the learner's background knowledge, and adjust their examples based on the learner's feedback. In Experiment 2, we show that learners strategically provide more feedback when the teacher's examples deviate from their background knowledge.

To solve this problem we propose an argument in favor of ‘belief-less reasoning’, a mode of inference that leads to converge on the optimal solution ignoring the beliefs of the other players. We argue that belief-less reasoning is supported by a commonsensical Principle of Relevant Information that every theory of rational decision must satisfy. We show that this principle can be used to justify (some versions of) team reasoning, as well as other schemes of practical reasoning that do not involve sophisticated meta-representation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",5,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Colombo","given":"Camilla"},{"family":"Guala","given":"Francesco"}],"citation-key":"colombo2021","container-title":"Erkenntnis","container-title-short":"Erkenn","DOI":"10.1007/s10670-021-00496-5","ISSN":"1572-8420","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",11,24]]},"language":"en","source":"Springer Link","title":"Rational Coordination Without Beliefs","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10670-021-00496-5"},

Originally proposed to account for perception, learning, and action, the free-energy principle has been applied to the evolution, development, morphology, anatomy and function of the brain, and has been called a postulate, an unfalsifiable principle, a natural law, and an imperative. While it might afford a theoretical foundation for understanding the relationship between environment, life, and mind, its epistemic status is unclear. Also unclear is how the free-energy principle relates to prominent theoretical approaches to life science phenomena, such as organicism and mechanism.

  {"id":"cooney2019","abstract":"We consider a stochastic model for evolution of group-structured populations in which interactions between group members correspond to the Prisoner’s Dilemma or the Hawk-Dove game. Selection operates at two organization levels: individuals compete with peer group members based on individual payoﬀ, while groups also compete with other groups based on average payoﬀ of group members. In the Prisoner’s Dilemma, this creates a tension between the two levels of selection, as defectors are favored at the individual level, whereas groups with at least some cooperators outperform groups of defectors at the between-group level. In the limit of inﬁnite group size and inﬁnite number of groups, we derive a non-local PDE that describes the probability distribution of group compositions in the population. For special families of payoﬀ matrices, we characterize the long-time behavior of solutions of our equation, ﬁnding a threshold intensity of between-group selection required to sustain density steady states and the survival of cooperation. When all-cooperator groups are most ﬁt, the average and most abundant group compositions at steady state range from featuring all-defector groups when individual-level selection dominates to featuring all-cooperator groups when group-level selection dominates. When the most ﬁt groups have a mix of cooperators and defectors, then the average and most abundant group compositions always feature a smaller fraction of cooperators than required for the optimal mix, even in the limit where group-level selection is inﬁnitely stronger than individual-level selection. In such cases, the conﬂict between the two levels of selection cannot be decoupled, and cooperation cannot be sustained at all in the case where between-group competition favors an even mix of cooperators and defectors.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Cooney","given":"Daniel B."}],"citation-key":"cooney2019","container-title":"Journal of Mathematical Biology","container-title-short":"J.

  {"id":"cortes2022","abstract":"Current debate surrounds the promise of neuroscience for education, including whether learning-related neural changes can predict learning transfer better than traditional performance-based learning assessments. Longstanding debate in philosophy and psychology concerns the proposition that spatial processes underlie seemingly nonspatial/verbal reasoning (mental model theory). If so, education that fosters spatial cognition might improve verbal reasoning. Here, in a quasi-experimental design in real-world STEM classrooms, a curriculum devised to foster spatial cognition yielded transfer to improved verbal reasoning. Further indicating a spatial basis for verbal transfer, students’ spatial cognition gains predicted and mediated their reasoning improvement. Longitudinal fMRI detected learning-related changes in neural activity, connectivity, and representational similarity in spatial cognition–implicated regions. Neural changes predicted and mediated learning transfer. Ensemble modeling demonstrated better prediction of transfer from neural change than from traditional measures (tests and grades). Results support in-school “spatial education” and suggest that neural change can inform future development of transferable curricula.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Cortes","given":"Robert A."},{"family":"Peterson","given":"Emily G."},{"family":"Kraemer","given":"David J.

Such models describe formal inferential relations between theories at diﬀerent levels. I argue against reduction and for a mechanistic model of interﬁeld integration. According to the mechanistic model, diﬀerent ﬁelds integrate their research by adding constraints on a multilevel description of a mechanism. Mechanistic integration may occur at a given level or in the eﬀort to build a theory that oscillates among several levels. I develop this alternative model using a putative exemplar of reduction in contemporary neuroscience: the relationship between the psychological phenomena of learning and memory and the electrophysiological phenomenon known as Long-Term Potentiation.

Molecular biologists study the mechanisms of protein synthesis and the myriad mechanisms of gene regulation. Ecologists study nutrient cycling mechanisms and their devastating imbalances in estuaries such as the Chesapeake Bay. In fact, much of biology and its history involves biologists constructing, evaluating, and revising their understanding of mechanisms. With In Search of Mechanisms, Carl F. Craver and Lindley Darden offer both a descriptive and an instructional account of how biologists discover mechanisms. Drawing on examples from across the life sciences and through the centuries, Craver and Darden compile an impressive toolbox of strategies that biologists have used and will use again to reveal the mechanisms that produce, underlie, or maintain the phenomena characteristic of living things. They discuss the questions that figure in the search for mechanisms, characterizing the experimental, observational, and conceptual considerations used to answer them, all the while providing examples from the history of biology to highlight the kinds of evidence and reasoning strategies employed to assess mechanisms. At a deeper level, Craver and Darden pose a systematic view of what biology is, of how biology makes progress, of how biological discoveries are and might be made, and of why knowledge of biological mechanisms is important for the future of the human species.","author":[{"family":"Craver","given":"Carl F."},{"family":"Darden","given":"Lindley"}],"citation-key":"craver2013","ISBN":"978-0-226-03982-4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",10,3]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"251","publisher":"University of Chicago Press","source":"Google Books","title":"In Search of Mechanisms: Discoveries across the Life Sciences","title-short":"In Search of Mechanisms","type":"book"},

My concern is with the minimal suggestion that an adequate philosophical theory of scientific explanation can limit its attention to the format or structure with which theories are represented. The representational subsumption view is a plausible hypothesis about the psychology of understanding. It is also a plausible claim about how scientists present their knowledge to the world. However, one cannot address the central questions for a philosophical theory of scientific explanation without turning one’s attention from the structure of representations to the basic commitments about the worldly structures that plausibly count as explanatory. A philosophical theory of scientific explanation should achieve two goals. The first is explanatory demarcation. It should show how explanation relates with other scientific achievements, such as control, description, measurement, prediction, and taxonomy. The second is explanatory normativity. It should say when putative explanations succeed and fail. One cannot achieve these goals without undertaking commitments about the kinds of ontic structures that plausibly count as explanatory. Representations convey explanatory information about a phenomenon when and only when they describe the ontic explanations for those phenomena.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",11,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Craver","given":"Carl F."}],"citation-key":"craver2014","collection-title":"Synthese Library","container-title":"Explanation in the Special Sciences: The Case of Biology and History","DOI":"10.1007/978-94-007-7563-3_2","editor":[{"family":"Kaiser","given":"Marie I."},{"family":"Scholz","given":"Oliver R."},{"family":"Plenge","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Hüttemann","given":"Andreas"}],"event-place":"Dordrecht","ISBN":"978-94-007-7563-3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]},"language":"en","page":"27-52","publisher":"Springer Netherlands","publisher-place":"Dordrecht","source":"Springer Link","title":"The Ontic Account of Scientific Explanation","type":"chapter","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-94-007-7563-3_2"},

The levels metaphor is spatial. Consequently, the levels metaphor is used in different domains to relate different items by different relations.

Levels of control and levels of processing are species of causal levels, which are defined by a particular asymmetrical causal relation among the hierarchically ordered items. In levels of control, the relata are agencies and the relation is some sort of dominance or subordination. Higher levels of control, direct, or regulate the goings-on at lower levels.

In contrast to current theories of common knowledge, Lewis' theory is based on an explicit analysis of the modes of reasoning that are accessible to rational individuals and so can be used to analyse the genesis of common knowledge.

  {"id":"day2003","abstract":", Niche construction refers to the capacity of organisms to construct, modify, and select important components of their local environments, such as nests, burrows, pupal cases, chemicals, and nutrients. A small but increasing number of evolutionary biologists regard niche construction as an evolutionary process in its own right, rather than as a mere product of natural selection. Through niche construction organisms not only influence the nature of their world, but also in part determine the selection pressures to which they and their descendants are exposed, and they do so in a non-random manner. Mathematical population genetics analyses have revealed that niche construction is likely to be evolutionarily consequential because of the feedback that it generates in the evolutionary process. A parallel movement has emerged in ecosystem ecology, where researchers stress the utility of regarding organisms as ecosystem engineers, who partly control energy and matter flows. From the niche construction standpoint, the evolving complementary match between organisms and environments is the product of reciprocal interacting processes of natural selection and niche construction. This essay reviews the arguments put forward in favor of the niche-construction perspective.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Day","given":"Rachel L"},{"family":"Laland","given":"Kevin N"},{"family":"Odling-Smee","given":"F.

In the philosophical literature, there has been a lively debate about the different desiderata that a good explicatum has to satisfy. In comparison, the goal of explicating the concept of explication itself has not been central to the philosophical debate. The main aim of this work is to suggest a way of filling this gap by explicating 'explication' by means of conceptual spaces theory. Specifically, I show how different, strictly-conceptual readings of explication desiderata can be made precise as geometrical or topological constraints over the conceptual spaces related to the explicandum and the explicatum. Moreover, I show also how the richness of the geometrical representation of concepts in conceptual spaces theory allows us to achieve more fine-grained readings of explication desiderata, thereby overcoming some alleged limitations of explication as a procedure of conceptual engineering.","author":[{"family":"De Benedetto","given":"Matteo"}],"citation-key":"debenedetto","container-title":"Erkenntnis","DOI":"10.1007/s10670-020-00221-8","title":"Explicating 'Explication' via Conceptual Spaces","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10670-020-00221-8?utm_source=researcher_app&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=RESR_MRKT_Researcher_inbound"},

We show that people are highly sensitive to the distinction between common knowledge and mere private or shared knowledge, and that they deploy this distinction strategically in diverse social situations that have the structure of coordination games, including market cooperation, innuendo, bystander intervention, attributions of charitability, self-conscious emotions, and moral condemnation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",5,27]]},"author":[{"family":"De Freitas","given":"Julian"},{"family":"Thomas","given":"Kyle"},{"family":"DeScioli","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Pinker","given":"Steven"}],"citation-key":"defreitas2019","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"Proc Natl Acad Sci USA","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1905518116","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","issue":"28","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",7,9]]},"language":"en","page":"13751-13758","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Common knowledge, coordination, and strategic mentalizing in human social life","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.pnas.org/lookup/doi/10.1073/pnas.1905518116","volume":"116"},
  {"id":"degaetano-ortlieb2019","abstract":"Abstract\n            We present a model of the linguistic development of scientific English from the mid-seventeenth to the late-nineteenth century, a period that witnessed significant political and social changes, including the evolution of modern science. There is a wealth of descriptive accounts of scientific English, both from a synchronic and a diachronic perspective, but only few attempts at a unified explanation of its evolution. The explanation we offer here is a communicative one: while external pressures (specialization, diversification) push for an increase in expressivity, communicative concerns pull toward convergence on particular options (conventionalization). What emerges over time is a code which is optimized for written, specialist communication, relying on specific linguistic means to modulate information content.

  {"id":"dejaegher2009","abstract":"Is an individual agent constitutive of or constituted by its social interactions? This question is typically not asked in the cognitive sciences, so strong is the consensus that only individual agents have constitutive efficacy. In this article we challenge this methodological solipsism and argue that interindividual relations and social context do not simply arise from the behavior of individual agents, but themselves enable and shape the individual agents on which they depend. For this, we define the notion of autonomy as both a characteristic of individual agents and of social interaction processes. We then propose a number of ways in which interactional autonomy can influence individuals. Then we discuss recent work in modeling on the one hand and psychological investigations on the other that support and illustrate this claim. Finally, we discuss some implications for research on social and individual agency.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,7]]},"author":[{"family":"De Jaegher","given":"Hanne"},{"family":"Froese","given":"Tom"}],"citation-key":"dejaegher2009","container-title":"Adaptive Behavior","container-title-short":"Adaptive Behavior","DOI":"10.1177/1059712309343822","ISSN":"1059-7123, 1741-2633","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",10]]},"language":"en","page":"444-460","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"On the Role of Social Interaction in Individual Agency","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1059712309343822","volume":"17"},

  {"id":"delanda2019","abstract":"In A New Philosophy of Society Manuel DeLanda offers a fascinating look at how the contemporary world is characterized by an extraordinary social complexity. Since most social entities, from small communities to large nation-states would disappear altogether if our cognitive abilities ceased to exist, DeLanda proposes a novel approach to social ontology that asserts the autonomy of social entities from the conceptions we have of them. He argues that Gilles Deleuze's theory of assemblages provides a framework in which sociologists and geographers studying social networks and regions can properly locate their work and fully elucidate the connections between them. Indeed, assemblage theory, as DeLanda argues, can be used to model any community, from interpersonal networks and institutional organizations, to central governments, cities and nation states.","author":[{"family":"DeLanda","given":"Manuel"}],"citation-key":"delanda2019","ISBN":"978-1-350-09675-2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",4,18]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"147","publisher":"Bloomsbury Publishing","source":"Google Books","title":"A New Philosophy of Society: Assemblage Theory and Social Complexity","title-short":"A New Philosophy of Society","type":"book"},

Why do some realities seem more real than others, and what of seemingly contradictory and multiple realities? This book considers reality as we represent, perceive and experience it. It suggests that the realities we take as 'real' are the result of real-time, situated practices that draw on and draw together many things - technologies and objects, people, gestures, meanings and media. Examining these practices illuminates reality (or rather our sense of it) as always 'virtually real', that is simplified and artfully produced. This examination also shows us how the sense of reality that we make is nonetheless real in its consequences. Making Sense of Reality offers students and educators a guide to analysing social life. It develops a performance-based perspective ('doing things with') that highlights the ever-revised dimension of realities and links this perspective to a focus on object-relations and an ecological model of culture-in-action.--Provided by publisher","author":[{"family":"DeNora","given":"Tia"}],"citation-key":"denora2014","edition":"1. publ","event-place":"Los Angeles, Calif","ISBN":"978-1-4739-0550-4 978-1-4462-0199-2 978-1-4462-0200-5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]},"language":"eng","number-of-pages":"168","publisher":"Sage","publisher-place":"Los Angeles, Calif","source":"K10plus ISBN","title":"Making sense of reality: culture and perception in everday life","title-short":"Making sense of reality","type":"book"},

While some scholars have argued that such applications are not possible (and will never be possible), others have been more optimistic and suggest that these are possible, albeit under certain conditions, for example when one aims to understand very basic cognitive processes. Concrete examples of these applications are increasing in the emerging interdisciplinary field of mind, brain, and education or educational neuroscience, which posits itself at the intersection of cognitive neuroscience, psychology, and educational research. From a methodological point of view, cognitive neuroscience can be applied to (some types of) educational research, as it offers a toolbox to investigate specific types of educational research questions. Promising applications of cognitive neuroscience to educational research include comprehending the origins of atypical development, understanding the biological processes that play a role when learning school-relevant skills, predicting educational outcomes, generating predictions to be tested in educational research, and undertaking biological interventions. The challenges of applying cognitive neuroscience deal with ecological validity, the scope of a biological explanation, and the potential emergence of neuromyths.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,21]]},"author":[{"family":"De Smedt","given":"Bert"}],"citation-key":"desmedt2018","container-author":[{"family":"De Smedt","given":"Bert"}],"container-title":"Oxford Research Encyclopedia of Education","DOI":"10.1093/acrefore/9780190264093.013.69","ISBN":"978-0-19-026409-3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",5,24]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Oxford University Press","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Applications of Cognitive Neuroscience in Educational Research","type":"chapter","URL":"https://oxfordre.com/education/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190264093.001.0001/acrefore-9780190264093-e-69"},

In the cognitive sciences, this polyphony has generally been conceptualised as a series of embedded 'orders of intentionality': A thinks that B understands that C expects... (etc.). I argue that this conceptualisation stands in stark contrast to how multiple perspectives are handled in actual discourse and interaction. Based on linguistic and narratological analysis of literary texts, newspaper articles, examples from spoken discourse, and stimuli from psychological experiments investigating multiple-order intentionality in the lab, a new perspective is offered on how we deal with networks of embedded and interlinked intentional states. The findings are discussed in the light of current theories about mindreading (a.k.a. ‘theory of mind’), discussing in particular cognitive models, issues of development and learning, and scenarios of how this capacity may have evolved in our lineage.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Duijn","given":"M.

We review the evolution of this field within sociology via bibliometric analysis and in-depth analysis of the following subfields where this new work is appearing most rapidly: (a) social network analysis and group formation; (b) collective behavior and political sociology; (c) the sociology of knowledge; (d) cultural sociology, social psychology, and emotions; (e) the production of culture; (f) economic sociology and organizations; and (g) demography and population studies. Our review reveals that sociologists are not only at the center of cutting-edge research that addresses longstanding questions about human behavior but also developing new lines of inquiry about digital spaces as well. We conclude by discussing challenging new obstacles in the field, calling for increased attention to sociological theory, and identifying new areas where computational social science might be further integrated into mainstream sociology.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Edelmann","given":"Achim"},{"family":"Wolff","given":"Tom"},{"family":"Montagne","given":"Danielle"},{"family":"Bail","given":"Christopher A."}],"citation-key":"edelmann2020","container-title":"Annual Review of Sociology","DOI":"10.1146/annurev-soc-121919-054621","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"page":"61-81","source":"Annual Reviews","title":"Computational Social Science and Sociology","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-soc-121919-054621","volume":"46"},

  {"id":"el-diraby2013","abstract":"An ontology is a claim on/for knowledge that attempts to model what is known about a domain of discourse. A domain ontology does not aim to exhaustively list all concepts in a domain, but rather to build an abstract (yet extendable) philosophical (yet practical) conceptualization of the essence of knowledge in a domain. At the core of any ontology is an ontological model—an architecture of how the world (in a domain) behaves (or becomes). The ontology categorizes construction knowledge across three main dimensions: concept, modality, and context. Concept encompasses five key terms: entity (further subdivided into generic and secondary), environmental element, abstract concept, attribute, and system (combinations of the previous four types). Modality is a means for generating a variety of types for each of the described concepts. Context allows for linking concepts in a variety of ways—creating different worlds.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,25]]},"author":[{"family":"El-Diraby","given":"Tamer E."}],"citation-key":"el-diraby2013","container-title":"Journal of Construction Engineering and Management","DOI":"10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000646","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",7]]},"page":"768-784","publisher":"American Society of Civil Engineers","source":"ascelibrary.org (Atypon)","title":"Domain Ontology for Construction Knowledge","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://ascelibrary.org/doi/abs/10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000646","volume":"139"},

The talk followed others by Christopher Winship and Frédéric Vandenberghe, which are mentioned in the text. The paper argues that critical social science needs an ontology of values, and that a coherent ontology must recognize that values are created by human beings in social settings, rather than being objectively true. Recognizing this, however, need not expose us to the moral nihilism of extreme relativism. Drawing on the work of Habermas and the capabilities approach, I argue that we can reason about what sorts of basic values we should be committed to, without invoking the concept of objective values. This provides us with material that we can build on to construct more complex constructive critical arguments.","author":[{"family":"Elder-Vass","given":"Dave"}],"citation-key":"elder-vass","container-title":"Journal of Critical Realism","DOI":"10.1080/14767430.2019.1614744","title":"Realism, values and critique","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14767430.2019.1614744?af=R"},

This book seeks to transform prevailing understandings of the relationship between realism and constructionism. It offers a thorough ontological analysis of the phenomena of language, discourse, culture, and knowledge, and shows how this justifies a realist version of social constructionism.

It is essentially a work of exposition that offers a tool box of mechanisms--nuts and bolts, cogs and wheels--that can be used to explain complex social phenomena. Within a brief compass, Jon Elster covers a vast range of topics. His point of departure is the conflict we all face between our desires and our opportunities. How can rational choice theory help us understand our motivation and behavior? More significantly, what happens when the theory breaks down but we still cleave to a belief in the power of the rational? Elster describes the fascinating range of forms of irrationality--wishful thinking, the phenomenon of sour grapes, discounting the future in non-cooperative behavior. He shows how these issues bear directly on our lives in such concrete situations as wage bargaining, economic cartels, political strikes, voting in elections, and court decisions involving child custody.","author":[{"family":"Elster","given":"Jon"}],"citation-key":"elster1989a","ISBN":"978-0-521-37606-8","issued":{"date-parts":[["1989",7,28]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"194","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"Google Books","title":"Nuts and Bolts for the Social Sciences","type":"book"},

  {"id":"ensorrafaelpalacios2020","abstract":"Abstract   Biological self-organisation can be regarded as a process of spontaneous pattern formation; namely, the emergence of structures that distinguish themselves from their environment. This process can occur at nested spatial scales: from the microscopic (e.g., the emergence of cells) to the macroscopic (e.g. the emergence of organisms). In this paper, we pursue the idea that Markov blankets – that separate the internal states of a structure from external states – can self-assemble at successively higher levels of organisation. Using simulations, based on the principle of variational free energy minimisation, we show that hierarchical self-organisation emerges when the microscopic elements of an ensemble have prior (e.g., genetic) beliefs that they participate in a macroscopic Markov blanket: i.e., they can only influence – or be influenced by – a subset of other elements. Furthermore, the emergent structures look very much like those found in nature (e.g., cells or organelles), when influences are mediated by short range signalling. These simulations are offered as a proof of concept that hierarchical self-organisation of Markov blankets (into Markov blankets) can explain the self-evidencing, autopoietic behaviour of biological systems.","author":[{"literal":"Ensor Rafael Palacios"},{"family":"Palacios","given":"Ensor Rafael"},{"literal":"Adeel Razi"},{"family":"Razi","given":"Adeel"},{"literal":"Thomas Parr"},{"family":"Parr","given":"Thomas"},{"literal":"Michael D.

I argue against prominent views that attempt to unify all social groups or to divide them into simple typologies.

I analyze social groups from a bottom-up perspective, constructing profiles of the metaphysical features of groups of specific kinds. We can characterize any given kind of social group with four complementary profiles: its \"construction\" profile, its \"extra essentials\" profile, its \"anchor\" profile, and its \"accident\" profile.

  {"id":"epstein2009","abstract":"The thesis of methodological individualism in social science is commonly divided into two different claims—explanatory individualism and ontological individualism. Ontological individualism is the thesis that facts about individuals exhaustively determine social facts. Initially taken to be a claim about the identity of groups with sets of individuals or their properties, ontological individualism has more recently been understood as a global supervenience claim. While explanatory individualism has remained controversial, ontological individualism thus understood is almost universally accepted. In this paper I argue that ontological individualism is false. Only if the thesis is weakened to the point that it is equivalent to physicalism can it be true, but then it fails to be a thesis about the determination of social facts by facts about individual persons. Even when individualistic facts are expanded to include people’s local environments and practices, I shall argue, those still underdetermine the social facts that obtain. If true, this has implications for explanation as well as ontology. I first consider arguments against the local supervenience of social facts on facts about individuals, correcting some flaws in existing arguments and affirming that local supervenience fails for a broad set of social properties. I subsequently apply a similar approach to defeat a particularly weak form of global supervenience, and consider potential responses. Finally, I explore why it is that people have taken ontological individualism to be true.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",11,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Epstein","given":"Brian"}],"citation-key":"epstein2009","container-title":"Synthese","container-title-short":"Synthese","DOI":"10.1007/s11229-007-9272-8","ISSN":"1573-0964","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"187-213","source":"Springer Link","title":"Ontological individualism reconsidered","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11229-007-9272-8","volume":"166"},

In Generative Social Science , Joshua Epstein argues that this powerful, novel technique permits the social sciences to meet a fundamentally new standard of explanation, in which one \"grows\" the phenomenon of interest in an artificial society of interacting agents: heterogeneous, boundedly rational actors, represented as mathematical or software objects. After elaborating this notion of generative explanation in a pair of overarching foundational chapters, Epstein illustrates it with examples chosen from such far-flung fields as archaeology, civil conflict, the evolution of norms, epidemiology, retirement economics, spatial games, and organizational adaptation. In elegant chapter preludes, he explains how these widely diverse modeling studies support his sweeping case for generative explanation. This book represents a powerful consolidation of Epstein's interdisciplinary research activities in the decade since the publication of his and Robert Axtell's landmark volume, Growing Artificial Societies . Beautifully illustrated, Generative Social Science includes a CD that contains animated movies of core model runs, and programs allowing users to easily change assumptions and explore models, making it an invaluable text for courses in modeling at all levels.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Epstein","given":"Joshua M."}],"citation-key":"epstein2012","DOI":"10.1515/9781400842872","ISBN":"978-1-4008-4287-2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",1,2]]},"language":"en","license":"De Gruyter expressly reserves the right to use all content for commercial text and data mining within the meaning of Section 44b of the German Copyright Act.","publisher":"Princeton University Press","source":"www.degruyter.com","title":"Generative Social Science: Studies in Agent-Based Computational Modeling","title-short":"Generative Social Science","type":"book","URL":"https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/9781400842872/html"},

  {"id":"epstein2018","abstract":"Social ontology is the study of the nature and properties of thesocial world. It is concerned with analyzing the various entities inthe world that arise from social interaction., A prominent topic in social ontology is the analysis of social groups.Do social groups exist at all? If so, what sorts of entities are they,and how are they created? Is a social group distinct from thecollection of people who are its members, and if so, how is itdifferent? What sorts of properties do social groups have? Can theyhave beliefs or intentions? Can they perform actions? And if so, whatdoes it take for a group to believe, intend, or act?, Other entities investigated in social ontology include money,corporations, institutions, property, social classes, races, genders,artifacts, artworks, language, and law. It is difficult to delineate aprecise scope for the field (see section 2.1). In general, though, the entities explored in social ontology largelyoverlap with those that social scientists work on. A good deal of thework in social ontology takes place within the social sciences (see sections 5.1–5.8)., Social ontology also addresses more basic questions about the natureof the social world. One set of questions pertains to theconstituents, or building blocks, of social things in general. Forinstance, some theories argue that social entities are built out ofthe psychological states of individual people, while others argue thatthey are built out of actions, and yet others that they are built outof practices. Still other theories deny that a distinction can even bemade between the social and the non-social., A different set of questions pertains to how social categories areconstructed or set up. Are social categories and kinds produced by ourattitudes? By our language? Are they produced by causal patterns? Andis there just one way social categories are set up, or are there manyvarieties of social construction?, The term ‘social ontology’ has only come into widecurrency in recent years, but the nature of the social has been atopic of inquiry since ancient Greece.

Recently, proponents of the free-energy principle and variational active inference have argued that their approach can deepen our understanding of the reciprocal causal relationship between organisms and their niche on various scales. This paper examines the feasibility and scope of variational formalisations and conceptualisations of the organism-niche nexus with a particular focus on the extended active inference account. I will draw a conceptual distinction between selective niche construction, developmental niche construction, and organism-niche coordination dynamics and argue that these notions capture different causal patterns, each of which with a distinct scope. Against this background, I will analyse and discuss the extended active inference account and its strategy to integrate variational active inference with work on extended cognition. The proponents of extended active inference assume that their account can provide an explanation of selective niche construction, developmental niche construction, and organism-niche coordination dynamics. However, my key claim will be that this account has the potential to elucidate the workings of organism-niche coordination dynamics, but does not adequately capture the causal patterns of selective niche construction and developmental niche construction.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Fabry","given":"Regina E."}],"citation-key":"fabry2021","container-title":"Biology & Philosophy","container-title-short":"Biol Philos","DOI":"10.1007/s10539-021-09782-6","ISSN":"1572-8404","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",2,15]]},"language":"en","page":"6","source":"Springer Link","title":"Limiting the explanatory scope of extended active inference: the implications of a causal pattern analysis of selective niche construction, developmental niche construction, and organism-niche coordination dynamics","title-short":"Limiting the explanatory scope of extended active inference","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10539-021-09782-6","volume":"36"},

The term 'pragmatic' has been introduced in cognitive science to reinforce the idea that cognition is a form of practice and to help action-oriented viewpoints to escape representationalism. In this paper, I shall try to demonstrate that Peirce's semiotic pragmatism can be a meaningful methodological path to guide a reconciliation between not only anti-Cartesianism and representation but also representation and action. In order to accomplish this purpose, Peirce's account to action, habit, thought and mind will be addressed through some of the guiding principles of his semiotic—sign and sign action.

By contrast, an additive strategy for valuation allows flexible combination of reward information required in uncertain or changing environments. We hypothesized that the level of uncertainty in the reward environment should determine the strategy used for valuation and choice. To test this hypothesis, we examined choice between risky options in humans and rhesus macaques across three tasks with different levels of uncertainty. We found that whereas humans and monkeys adopted a multiplicative strategy under risk when probabilities are known, both species spontaneously adopted an additive strategy under uncertainty when probabilities must be learned. Additionally, the level of volatility influenced relative weighting of certain and uncertain reward information, and this was reflected in the encoding of reward magnitude by neurons in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Farashahi","given":"Shiva"},{"family":"Donahue","given":"Christopher H."},{"family":"Hayden","given":"Benjamin Y."},{"family":"Lee","given":"Daeyeol"},{"family":"Soltani","given":"Alireza"}],"citation-key":"farashahi2019","container-title":"Nature Human Behaviour","container-title-short":"Nat Hum Behav","DOI":"10.1038/s41562-019-0714-3","ISSN":"2397-3374","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",11]]},"language":"en","license":"2019 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited","note":"Bandiera_abtest: a\nCg_type: Nature Research Journals\nPrimary_atype: Research\nSubject_term: Decision;Human behaviour;Reward\nSubject_term_id: decision;human-behaviour;reward","number":"11","page":"1215-1224","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Flexible combination of reward information across primates","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-019-0714-3","volume":"3"},

This leads to confusion, and consequently, people from various research communities use the term with different – sometimes incompatible – meanings.

By way of two business case studies, both their potential in ontological engineering and the perceived requirements for ontologies are highlighted, and their misuse in research and business is discussed. In order to examine the case for applying ontologies in a specific domain or use case, the main benefits of using ontologies are defined and categorized as technical-centered or user-centered. Key factors that influence the use of ontologies in business applications are derived and discussed. Finally, the paper offers a recommendation for efficiently applying ontologies, including adequate representation languages and an ontological engineering process supported by reference ontologies. To answer the questions of when ontologies should be used, how they can be used efficiently, and when they should not be used, we propose guidelines for selecting an appropriate model, methodology, and tool set to meet customer requirements while making most efficient use of resources.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Feilmayr","given":"Christina"},{"family":"Wöß","given":"Wolfram"}],"citation-key":"feilmayr2016","container-title":"Data & Knowledge Engineering","container-title-short":"Data & Knowledge Engineering","DOI":"10.1016/j.datak.2015.11.003","ISSN":"0169-023X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",1,1]]},"page":"1-23","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"An analysis of ontologies and their success factors for application to business","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169023X1500110X","volume":"101"},

  {"id":"fernándezdomingos2023","abstract":"Evolutionary Game Theory (EGT) provides an important framework to study collective behavior. It combines ideas from evolutionary biology and population dynamics with the game theoretical modeling of strategic interactions. Its importance is highlighted by the numerous high level publications that have enriched different fields, ranging from biology to social sciences, in many decades. Nevertheless, there has been no open source library that provided easy, and efficient, access to these methods and models. Here, we introduce EGTtools, an efficient hybrid C++/Python library which provides fast implementations of both analytical and numerical EGT methods. EGTtools is able to analytically evaluate a system based on the replicator dynamics. It is also able to evaluate any EGT problem resorting to finite populations and large-scale Markov processes. Finally, it resorts to C++ and MonteCarlo simulations to estimate many important indicators, such as stationary or strategy distributions. We illustrate all these methodologies with concrete examples and analysis.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Fernández Domingos","given":"Elias"},{"family":"Santos","given":"Francisco C."},{"family":"Lenaerts","given":"Tom"}],"citation-key":"fernándezdomingos2023","container-title":"iScience","container-title-short":"iScience","DOI":"10.1016/j.isci.2023.106419","ISSN":"2589-0042","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,21]]},"page":"106419","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"EGTtools: Evolutionary game dynamics in Python","title-short":"EGTtools","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589004223004960","volume":"26"},
  {"id":"fernandezmoreno","abstract":"This article is an introduction to the Synthese Special Issue, Natural Kinds: Language, Science, and Metaphysics. The issue includes new contributions to some of the main questions involved in the present philosophical debates on natural kinds and on natural kind terms. Those debates are relevant to philosophy of language, philosophy of science, and metaphysics. In philosophy of language it is highly debated what the meaning of natural kind terms is, how their reference is determined, as well as whether there are differences and similarities between the semantics of natural kind terms and that of other sorts of kind terms. In philosophy of science, natural kinds are relevant because they are the basis for scientific classifications and play an explanatory role in scientific theories; thus one aim of science is to discover natural kinds and theorize about them. Natural kinds are also relevant in metaphysics, where many questions involving natural kinds are debated and especially those concerning the sort of entities we refer to when using natural kind terms, i.e., the ontological status of natural kinds; in this regard there are different views, such as conventionalism, realism and essentialism. Another metaphysical question is what it is that characterizes the naturalness of kind divisions. The introduction sketches the antecedents of some of the present views on natural kinds and natural kind terms, and indicates some of the topics dealt with in the articles that make up the issue, which can be classified in the following groups: (1) the metaphysics and epistemology of natural kinds (2) the semantics of natural kind terms and other kind terms (3) questions on species and (4) other related issues on natural kinds. However, many of the articles cover more than just one of these topics.","author":[{"family":"Fernández Moreno","given":"Luis"}],"citation-key":"fernandezmoreno","container-title":"Synthese","DOI":"10.1007/s11229-019-02325-3","title":"Reflection on natural kinds.

Yet, despite the wealth of evidence that has accumulated for culture in non-human animals, we know surprisingly little about non-human conventions beyond a few rare examples. We follow the literature in behavioural ecology and evolution and define conventions as systematic behaviours that solve a coordination problem in which two or more individuals need to display complementary behaviour to obtain a mutually beneficial outcome. We start by discussing the literature on conventions in non-human primates from this perspective and conclude that all the ingredients for conventions to emerge are present and therefore that they ought to be more frequently observed. We then probe the emergence of conventions by using a unique novel experimental system in which pairs of Guinea baboons (Papio papio) can voluntarily participate together in touchscreen-based cognitive testing and we show that conventions readily emerge in our experimental set-up and that they share three fundamental properties of human conventions (arbitrariness, stability and efficiency). These results question the idea that observational learning, and imitation in particular, is necessary to establish conventions; they suggest that positive reinforcement is enough.\n\nThis article is part of a discussion meeting issue ‘The emergence of collective knowledge and cumulative culture in animals, humans and machines’.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Formaux","given":"Anthony"},{"family":"Paleressompoulle","given":"Dany"},{"family":"Fagot","given":"Joël"},{"family":"Claidière","given":"Nicolas"}],"citation-key":"formaux2021","container-title":"Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","DOI":"10.1098/rstb.2020.0310","issue":"1843","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,13]]},"page":"20200310","publisher":"Royal Society","source":"royalsocietypublishing.org (Atypon)","title":"The experimental emergence of convention in a non-human primate","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2020.0310","volume":"377"},
  {"id":"forster2012","abstract":"This dissertation reexamines the role of behavioral analysis to propose a modified research program for socio- cognitive phenomena--demonstrating its potential by presenting a two-step proof-of-concept on baboon data. I build on two Complex Systems Thinking approaches to behavior -- Hinde's model of social complexity, and Hutchins' theory of distributed cognition. By giving Hinde and Hutchins a state-space framing I can apply a well- established tool-kit of sequential analysis for social interactions. These analyses represent a shift in emphasis from asking 'what-is-it-for' to how-does-it-work'. First, I examine male-female-infant relations in the period after birth to demonstrate how to create a more systematic tracking of social complexity, emphasizing context : By building immediate context directly into the data- structures I can use the same data structure to look at study factors from long-term cumulative context of both relationships and group structure. By analyzing state- transitions over independent tallies I am able to relate interaction dynamics more directly to successive levels of social complexity. Second, I track distributed cognition by looking at consort turnover (CTO) events as socio- cognitive systems that resolve 'who will be the next consort male?' Instead of performance measures based on outcome, the system-level regularities allow me to track individual profiles of participation. Behavioral traces of Extended-Embodied Distributed Cognition 'leak' outward from the skull to the physical and social environment and spread to the whole body. I use a video segment of a CTO event to demonstrate how to capture embodied attention by tracking head movements relative to body orientation. The proof-of-concept demonstrate how a state-space approach and the tools of sequential analysis-multiway contingency tables analysis for categorical data and timeseries analysis for continuous data representation-provides a shared framing that allows integrating the pieces of social complexity and distributed cognition into a single research program to look at socio-cognitive phenomena in other contexts and across species. Polyadic interactions offer opportunities to see inside the black boxes of social complexity and cognition. Analyzing socio-cognitive behavior at multiple levels of social complexity can be viewed as an extra-somatic extension of Senjowski & Churchland (1990) now famous hierarchy of structural levels of brain investigation","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Forster","given":"Deborah"}],"citation-key":"forster2012","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012"]]},"source":"Semantic Scholar","title":"A state-space approach to social complexity and distributed cognition in olive baboons (Papio anubis) : rethinking the role of behavioral analysis in socio-cognitive research","title-short":"A state-space approach to social complexity and distributed cognition in olive baboons (Papio anubis)","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/A-state-space-approach-to-social-complexity-and-in-Forster/7f6df3483acef3a7820782e4deebb576db5b810b"},

To address this operationalization problem, scientists often assess whether tasks engage the same neural mechanisms. To determine whether mechanisms are of the same kind, however, we need to solve the abstraction problem by determining which physical differences we can gloss over, and the boundary problem by distinguishing the mechanism from its background conditions. Solving these problems requires understanding how cognitive capacities are elicited in tasks. We argue that this ‘cycle of kinds’ is an iterative process that yields progress only incrementally.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",11,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Francken","given":"Jolien C."},{"family":"Slors","given":"Marc"},{"family":"Craver","given":"Carl F."}],"citation-key":"francken2020","genre":"Preprint","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",10,6]]},"language":"en","title":"Cognitive Ontology and the Search for Neural Mechanisms: Three Foundational Problems","title-short":"Cognitive Ontology and the Search for Neural Mechanisms","type":"webpage","URL":"http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/18517/"},

To validate our proposal, we run proof-of-concept simulations in the economic ultimatum game, formalizing user preferences as policies that guide the actions of simulated players. We find that the AI assistant accurately aligns its behavior to match standard policies from the economic literature (e.g., selfish, altruistic). However, the assistant's learned policies lack robustness and exhibit limited generalization in an out-of-distribution setting when confronted with a currency (e.g., grams of medicine) that was not included in the assistant's training distribution. Additionally, we find that when there is inconsistency in the relationship between language use and an unknown policy (e.g., an altruistic policy combined with rude language), the assistant's learning of the policy is slowed. Overall, our preliminary results suggest that developing simulation frameworks in which AI assistants need to infer preferences from diverse users can provide a valuable approach for studying practical alignment questions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Fränken","given":"Jan-Philipp"},{"family":"Kwok","given":"Sam"},{"family":"Ye","given":"Peixuan"},{"family":"Gandhi","given":"Kanishk"},{"family":"Arumugam","given":"Dilip"},{"family":"Moore","given":"Jared"},{"family":"Tamkin","given":"Alex"},{"family":"Gerstenberg","given":"Tobias"},{"family":"Goodman","given":"Noah D."}],"citation-key":"fränken2023","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2310.17769","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,3]]},"number":"arXiv:2310.17769","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Social Contract AI: Aligning AI Assistants with Implicit Group Norms","title-short":"Social Contract AI","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17769"},

  {"id":"french2014","abstract":"In The Structure of the World, Steven French articulates and defends the bold claim that there are no objects. At the most fundamental level, modern physics presents us with a world of structures and making sense of that view is the central aim of the increasingly widespread position known as structural realism. Drawing on contemporary work in metaphysics and philosophy of science, as well as the 'forgotten' history of structural realism itself, French attempts to further ground and develop this position. He argues that structural realism offers the best way of balancing our need to accommodate the results of modern science with our desire to arrive at an appropriately informed understanding of the world that science presents to us. Covering not only the realism-antirealism debate, the nature of representation, and the relationship between metaphysics and science, The Structure of the World defends a form of eliminativism about objects that sets laws and symmetry principles at the heart of ontology. In place of a world of microscopic objects banging into one another and governed by the laws of physics, it offers a world of laws and symmetries, on which determinate physical properties are dependent. In presenting this account, French also tackles the distinction between mathematical and physical structures, the nature of laws, and causality in the context of modern physics, and he concludes by exploring the extent to which structural realism can be extended into chemistry and biology.","author":[{"family":"French","given":"Steven"}],"citation-key":"french2014","ISBN":"978-0-19-968484-7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"413","publisher":"OUP Oxford","source":"Google Books","title":"The Structure of the World: Metaphysics and Representation","title-short":"The Structure of the World","type":"book"},

  {"id":"friston2010","abstract":"Adaptive agents must occupy a limited repertoire of states and therefore minimize the long-term average of surprise associated with sensory exchanges with the world. Minimizing surprise enables them to resist a natural tendency to disorder.Surprise rests on predictions about sensations, which depend on an internal generative model of the world. Although surprise cannot be measured directly, a free-energy bound on surprise can be, suggesting that agents minimize free energy by changing their predictions (perception) or by changing the predicted sensory inputs (action).Perception optimizes predictions by minimizing free energy with respect to synaptic activity (perceptual inference), efficacy (learning and memory) and gain (attention and salience). This furnishes Bayes-optimal (probabilistic) representations of what caused sensations (providing a link to the Bayesian brain hypothesis).Bayes-optimal perception is mathematically equivalent to predictive coding and maximizing the mutual information between sensations and the representations of their causes. This is a probabilistic generalization of the principle of efficient coding (the infomax principle) or the minimum-redundancy principle.Learning under the free-energy principle can be formulated in terms of optimizing the connection strengths in hierarchical models of the sensorium. This rests on associative plasticity to encode causal regularities and appeals to the same synaptic mechanisms as those underlying cell assembly formation.Action under the free-energy principle reduces to suppressing sensory prediction errors that depend on predicted (expected or desired) movement trajectories. This provides a simple account of motor control, in which action is enslaved by perceptual (proprioceptive) predictions.Perceptual predictions rest on prior expectations about the trajectory or movement through the agent's state space. These priors can be acquired (as empirical priors during hierarchical inference) or they can be innate (epigenetic) and therefore subject to selective pressure.Predicted motion or state transitions realized by action correspond to policies in optimal control theory and reinforcement learning. In this context, value is inversely proportional to surprise (and implicitly free energy), and rewards correspond to innate priors that constrain policies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Friston","given":"Karl"}],"citation-key":"friston2010","container-title":"Nature Reviews Neuroscience","container-title-short":"Nat Rev Neurosci","DOI":"10.1038/nrn2787","ISSN":"1471-0048","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",2]]},"language":"en","license":"2010 Nature Publishing Group","number":"2","page":"127-138","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"The free-energy principle: a unified brain theory?","title-short":"The free-energy principle","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn2787","volume":"11"},
  {"id":"friston2011","abstract":"It has been suggested recently that action and perception can be understood as minimising the free energy of sensory samples. This ensures that agents sample the environment to maximise the evidence for their model of the world, such that exchanges with the environment are predictable and adaptive. However, the free energy account does not invoke reward or cost-functions from reinforcement-learning and optimal control theory. We therefore ask whether reward is necessary to explain adaptive behaviour. The free energy formulation uses ideas from statistical physics to explain action in terms of minimising sensory surprise. Conversely, reinforcement-learning has its roots in behaviourism and engineering and assumes that agents optimise a policy to maximise future reward. This paper tries to connect the two formulations and concludes that optimal policies correspond to empirical priors on the trajectories of hidden environmental states, which compel agents to seek out the (valuable) states they expect to encounter.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Friston","given":"Karl"},{"family":"Ao","given":"Ping"}],"citation-key":"friston2011","container-title":"Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine","DOI":"10.1155/2012/937860","ISSN":"1748-670X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",12,21]]},"language":"en","page":"e937860","publisher":"Hindawi","source":"www.hindawi.com","title":"Free Energy, Value, and Attractors","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/cmmm/2012/937860/","volume":"2012"},
  {"id":"friston2013","abstract":"This paper considers agency in the setting of embodied or active inference. In brief, we associate a sense of agency with prior beliefs about action and ask what sorts of beliefs underlie optimal behavior. In particular, we consider prior beliefs that action minimizes the Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence between desired states and attainable states in the future. This allows one to formulate bounded rationality as approximate Bayesian inference that optimizes a free energy bound on model evidence. We show that constructs like expected utility, exploration bonuses, softmax choice rules and optimism bias emerge as natural consequences of this formulation. Previous accounts of active inference have focused on predictive coding and Bayesian filtering schemes for minimizing free energy. Here, we consider variational Bayes as an alternative scheme that provides formal constraints on the computational anatomy of inference and action—constraints that are remarkably consistent with neuroanatomy. Furthermore, this scheme contextualizes optimal decision theory and economic (utilitarian) formulations as pure inference problems. For example, expected utility theory emerges as a special case of free energy minimization, where the sensitivity or inverse temperature (of softmax functions and quantal response equilibria) has a unique and Bayes-optimal solution—that minimizes free energy. This sensitivity corresponds to the precision of beliefs about behavior, such that attainable goals are afforded a higher precision or confidence. In turn, this means that optimal behavior entails a representation of confidence about outcomes that are under an agent's control.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Friston","given":"Karl"},{"family":"Schwartenbeck","given":"Philipp"},{"family":"Fitzgerald","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Moutoussis","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Behrens","given":"Tim"},{"family":"Dolan","given":"Raymond"}],"citation-key":"friston2013","container-title":"Frontiers in Human Neuroscience","ISSN":"1662-5161","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013"]]},"source":"Frontiers","title":"The anatomy of choice: active inference and agency","title-short":"The anatomy of choice","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2013.00598","volume":"7"},

First the use of systems is identified as a key element in generative art. Various ideas from complexity theory are then introduced. It is noted that systems exist on a continuum from the highly ordered to the highly disordered. Citing examples from information theory and complexity science, it is noted that highly ordered and highly disordered systems are typically viewed as simple, and complex systems exhibit both order and disorder. This leads to the adoption of effective complexity, order, and disorder as organizing principles in the comparison of various generative art systems. This inclusive view leads to the somewhat surprising observation that generative art is as old as art itself. A number of specific artists and studies are discussed within this systems and complexity theory influenced paradigm. Finally a number of art theoretical questions are introduced to exercise the suggested generative art definition and implicit paradigm.","author":[{"family":"Galanter","given":"Philip"}],"citation-key":"galanter","language":"en","page":"21","source":"Zotero","title":"What is Generative Art?

We suggest that the benefits of perspective-taking accrue through an increased self-other overlap in cognitive representations and discuss the implications of this perspective-taking induced self-other overlap for stereotyping and prejudice. Whereas perspective-taking decreases stereotyping of others (through application of the self to the other), it increases stereotypicality of one's own behavior (through inclusion of the other in the self). To promote social bonds, perspective-takers utilize information, including stereotypes, to coordinate their behavior with others. The discussion focuses on the implications, both positive and negative, of this self-other overlap for social relationships and discusses how conceptualizing perspective-taking, as geared toward supporting specific social bonds, provides a framework for understanding why the effects of perspective-taking are typically target-specific and do not activate a general helping mind-set.

  {"id":"gallotti2012","abstract":"According to many philosophers and scientists, human sociality is explained by our unique capacity to “share” attitudes with others. The conditions under which mental states are shared have been widely debated in the past two decades, focusing especially on the issue of their reducibility to individual intentionality and the place of collective intentions in the natural realm. It is not clear, however, to what extent these two issues are related and what methodologies of investigation are appropriate in each case. In this article, I propose a solution that distinguishes between epistemic and ontological interpretations of the demand for the conditions of reduction of collective intentionality. While the philosophical debate has contributed important insights into the former, recent advances in the cognitive sciences offer novel resources to tackle the latter. Drawing on Michael Tomasello’s research in the ontogeny of shared intentionality in early instances of interaction based on joint attention, I propose an empirically informed argument of what it would take to address the ontological question of irreducibility, thus making a step forward in the naturalization of collective intentionality.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",2,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Gallotti","given":"Mattia"}],"citation-key":"gallotti2012","container-title":"Philosophy of the Social Sciences","container-title-short":"Philosophy of the Social Sciences","DOI":"10.1177/0048393111426864","ISSN":"0048-3931","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",3,1]]},"language":"en","page":"3-30","publisher":"SAGE Publications Inc","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"A Naturalistic Argument for the Irreducibility of Collective Intentionality","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0048393111426864","volume":"42"},

A closer look at the philosophical literature reveals that mechanisms are predominantly modeled in a purely qualitative way. That is, mechanistic models are conceived of as representing how certain entities and activities are spatially and temporally organized so that they bring about the behavior of the mechanism in question. Although this adequately characterizes how mechanisms are represented in biology textbooks, contemporary biological research practice shows the need for quantitative, probabilistic models of mechanisms, too. In this chapter, we argue that the formal framework of causal graph theory is well suited to provide us with models of biological mechanisms that incorporate quantitative and probabilistic information. On the basis of an example from contemporary biological practice, namely, feedback regulation of fatty acid biosynthesis in Brassica napus, we show that causal graph theoretical models can account for feedback as well as for the multilevel character of mechanisms. However, we do not claim that causal graph theoretical representations of mechanisms are advantageous in all respects and should replace common qualitative models. Rather, we endorse the more balanced view that causal graph theoretical models of mechanisms are useful for some purposes while being insufficient for others.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",11,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Gebharter","given":"Alexander"},{"family":"Kaiser","given":"Marie I."}],"citation-key":"gebharter2014","collection-title":"Synthese Library","container-title":"Explanation in the Special Sciences: The Case of Biology and History","DOI":"10.1007/978-94-007-7563-3_3","editor":[{"family":"Kaiser","given":"Marie I."},{"family":"Scholz","given":"Oliver R."},{"family":"Plenge","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Hüttemann","given":"Andreas"}],"event-place":"Dordrecht","ISBN":"978-94-007-7563-3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]},"language":"en","page":"55-85","publisher":"Springer Netherlands","publisher-place":"Dordrecht","source":"Springer Link","title":"Causal Graphs and Biological Mechanisms","type":"chapter","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-94-007-7563-3_3"},
  {"id":"genov2019","abstract":"The multidimensional and rapid changes of contemporary societies provoke the need for a process-oriented and flexible sociology which is strong in explanatory terms. Instead, the general picture of present day international sociology is sobering. Divided into a number of streams, directions, theoretical and methodological orientations it can hardly produce cumulative scientific knowledge. This is the reason why observers define the current situation of sociology as pre-science according to the Kuhnian terminology. The usual stress on the multi-paradigmatic character of sociology only strengthens this theoretical and methodological deadlock.Is there a way to get out of it? The article offers a positive answer to the question.It is focused on the need to develop and apply a new paradigm of sociological theorizing and research. It is expected to meet strategic requirements. They include the correspondence to basic parameters of social reality, the expected epistemic and methodological efficiency and axiological link to practical action. After checking the potentials of major paradigmatic orientations in sociology the conclusion is that the core of the promising paradigmatic innovation could be a broadly defined concept of social interaction. It is intended to support the building and explanatory application of middle-range theories in all action spheres and at all micro-, mezzoand macro-social structures and processes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Nikolai","given":"Genov"}],"citation-key":"genov2019","container-title":"Журнал социологии и социальной антропологии","event-place":"Россия, Санкт-Петербург","ISSN":"1029-8053","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"number":"1","page":"24-46","publisher":"Фонд «Международный Фонд поддержки социогуманитарных исследований и образовательных программ»","publisher-place":"Россия, Санкт-Петербург","source":"cyberleninka.ru","title":"Multi-paradigmatic sociology: debates present and perennial","title-short":"Multi-paradigmatic sociology","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://cyberleninka.ru/article/n/multi-paradigmatic-sociology-debates-present-and-perennial","volume":"22"},

On the ground level, we engage in person-to-person interactions and treat each other as having normative statuses: commitments and entitlements.

On the third level, we interact with and within social institutions: families, schools, villages, clubs, etc. All these structures serve to coordinate activities, all are normative, and communication is essential throughout: the primary function of language is to negotiate normative statuses, and we communicate with one another to deﬁne and allocate roles, as well as to create, maintain, and regulate our interactions with and within institutions. This chapter outlines how communicative practices coevolved with these social structures, with special emphasis on the normativity of human sociality in general and communication in particular.","author":[{"family":"Geurts","given":"Bart"}],"citation-key":"geurts2023","language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"Normative pragmatics and social structures: an evolutionary perspective","type":"article-journal"},

In addition, we present computational intricacies of a recently developed model (named MIX model) representing an algorithmic implementation of the additive strategy in sequential decision-making with two options. We also discuss its opportunities; and conceptual, inferential, and generalization issues.

But I also argue that there are good epistemological and phenomenological reasons for thinking that there is generality in perception. In particular, I focus on Brewer's purely relationalist account and I argue that it either fails to satisfy important phenomenological and epistemological requirements, or it introduces generality in a way that makes it collapse into CV.

  {"id":"gigerenzer2002","abstract":"In a complex and uncertain world, humans and animals make decisions under the constraints of limited knowledge, resources, and time. Yet models of rational decision making in economics, cognitive science, biology, and other fields largely ignore these real constraints and instead assume agents with perfect information and unlimited time. About forty years ago, Herbert Simon challenged this view with his notion of \"bounded rationality.\" Today, bounded rationality has become a fashionable term used for disparate views of reasoning.This book promotes bounded rationality as the key to understanding how real people make decisions. Using the concept of an \"adaptive toolbox,\" a repertoire of fast and frugal rules for decision making under uncertainty, it attempts to impose more order and coherence on the idea of bounded rationality. The contributors view bounded rationality neither as optimization under constraints nor as the study of people's reasoning fallacies. The strategies in the adaptive toolbox dispense with optimization and, for the most part, with calculations of probabilities and utilities. The book extends the concept of bounded rationality from cognitive tools to emotions; it analyzes social norms, imitation, and other cultural tools as rational strategies; and it shows how smart heuristics can exploit the structure of environments.","author":[{"family":"Gigerenzer","given":"Gerd"},{"family":"Selten","given":"Reinhard"}],"citation-key":"gigerenzer2002","ISBN":"978-0-262-57164-7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2002",7,26]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"404","publisher":"MIT Press","source":"Google Books","title":"Bounded Rationality: The Adaptive Toolbox","title-short":"Bounded Rationality","type":"book"},
  {"id":"gilbert1992","abstract":"Are social groups real in any sense that is independent of the thoughts, actions, and beliefs of the individuals making up the group? Using methods of philosophy to examine such longstanding sociological questions, Margaret Gilbert gives a general characterization of the core phenomena at issue in the domain of human social life. After developing detailed analyses of a number of central everyday concepts of social phenomena--including shared action, a social convention, a group's belief, and a group itself--she proposes that the core social phenomena among human beings are \"plural subject\" phenomena. In her analyses Gilbert discusses the work of such thinkers as Emile Durkheim, Georg Simmel, Max Weber, and David Lewis. \"Gilbert's book aims to ... exhibit some general and structural features of the conceptual scheme in terms of which we think about social groups, collective action, social convention, and shared belief....

An account of convention need not be judged by that standard. Perhaps it reveals the nature of an important phenomenon. Looked at in that light, these very different accounts are not incompatible.

  {"id":"glennan2017","abstract":"This book argues for a new image of nature and of science—one that understands both natural and social phenomena to be the product of mechanisms, and that suggests that much of the work of natural and social scientists involves discovering, describing, and explaining how these mechanisms work. The book explores the interplay between ontological questions about mechanisms as things in the world and methodological questions about how these mechanisms can be characterized. Ontologically, mechanisms are understood to be collections of entities whose organized activities and interactions give rise to phenomena. This minimal conception of mechanism is abstract enough to encompass most of the wide variety of things that scientists have called mechanisms. While mechanisms are particular things, localized in space and time, the models that scientists use to describe them must be abstract and idealized. The mechanistic approach provides new ways of thinking about traditional metaphysical questions—for instance, about the nature of objects, part-whole and cause-effect relations, properties and universals, natural kinds, and laws of nature. It also suggests novel approaches for thinking about methodological questions concerning scientific representation, causal inference, reduction, and scientific explanation. The New Mechanical Philosophy offers the promise of a better understanding of the sources of both the unity and diversity of science.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Glennan","given":"Stuart"}],"citation-key":"glennan2017","DOI":"10.1093/oso/9780198779711.001.0001","ISBN":"978-0-19-877971-1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",9,21]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Oxford University Press","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The New Mechanical Philosophy","type":"book","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/book/9835","volume":"1"},

Dretske, Fodor and many others think that some organisms, including people, contain inner states and structures which represent the world, and do so as a matter of objective fact. Philosophy should aim to describe the connections between facts about the use of difficult and controversial concepts, and facts about the parts of the world that the concepts are in some sense aimed at dealing with. Philosophy should link the empirical facts about human knowledge-ascriptions with the facts about how beliefs are regulated and how beliefs enable organisms to get around the world. From the point of view of Dennett's picture, the Dretske–Fodor view is mistaken because it does not take seriously the special properties of human interpretive practices; interpretation is not just an attempt to lay out the hidden structure of a complex machine.

  {"id":"goffman1970","abstract":"The two essays in this classic work by sociologist Erving Goffman deal with the calculative, gamelike aspects of human interaction. Goffman examines the strategy of words and deeds; he uses the term &quot;strategic interaction&quot; to describe gamelike events in which an individual&#39;s situation is fully dependent on the move of one&#39;s opponent and in which both players know this and have the wit to use this awareness for advantage. Goffman aims to show that strategic interaction can be isolated analytically from the general study of communication and face-to-face interaction. The first essay addresses expression games, in which a participant spars to discover the value of information given openly or unwittingly by another. The author uses vivid examples from espionage literature and high-level political intrigue to show how people mislead one another in the information game. Both observer and observed create evidence that is false and uncover evidence that is real. In &quot;Strategic Interaction,&quot; the book&#39;s second essay, action is the central concern, and expression games are secondary. Goffman makes clear that often, when it seems that an opponent sets off a course of action through verbal communication, he really has a finger on your trigger, your chips on the table, or your check in his bank. Communication may reinforce conduct, but in the end, action speaks louder. Those who gamble with their wits, and those who study those who do, will find this analysis important and stimulating.","author":[{"family":"Goffman","given":"Erving"}],"citation-key":"goffman1970","ISBN":"978-0-8122-1011-8","issued":{"date-parts":[["1970"]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"155","publisher":"University of Pennsylvania Press","source":"Google Books","title":"Strategic Interaction","type":"book"},

We identify classes of coordination games in which coordination cannot be guaranteed in a single round, but can eventually be achieved in several rounds by following suitable coordination protocols. In particular, we study coordination using protocols invariant under structural symmetries of games under some natural assumptions, such as: priority hierarchies amongst players, different patience thresholds, use of focal groups, and gradual coordination by contact.","author":[{"family":"Goranko","given":"Valentin"},{"family":"Kuusisto","given":"Antti"},{"family":"Rönnholm","given":"Raine"}],"citation-key":"goranko2020a","container-title":"Santiago de Compostela","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"language":"en","page":"8","source":"Zotero","title":"Gradual guaranteed coordination in repeated win-lose coordination games","type":"article-journal"},

This academic plurality perfectly characterizes the complexity with which a current researcher is confronted to discuss and work on this topic. The volume is organized as follows: Part I introduces the general problems of Philosophy of Mind and some historical perspectives. Part II focuses on understanding the input that the empirical sciences can offer to the theoretical problems. Part III discusses some of the core concepts of the field, namely, perception, memory and experience. Part IV debates human and artificial intelligence and, finally, Part V deliberates about the computation and the ethics of big data and artificial intelligence.The book contains valuable material for researchers in several fields such as Cognitive Science and Neuroscience, Psychology and Artificial Intelligence, and Philosophy. It can also be used as a guide to some courses at various levels, from BAs to MAs and PhD courses of several fields. It is our belief, as it is claimed in the preface by Georg Northoff, that there is an urgent need for a truly transdisciplinary exchange between philosophy and the sciences in order to stimulate some real progress.

We introduce the notion of non-exclusive conventions to model the idea that, by incurring some additional costs, agents can remain flexible and hence coordinate their activities more successfully. We show that if these costs of flexibility are low (high) and interaction is local then the Pareto-efficient (risk-dominant) convention prevails in both communities. At intermediate cost levels, the conventions coexist. We also show that the importance of relative size of the two communities varies across interaction structures.Journal of Economic LiteratureClassification Numbers: C7, D6, F15, Z1. © 1997 Academic Press.","archive":"Scopus","author":[{"family":"Goyal","given":"S."},{"family":"Janssen","given":"M.C.W."}],"citation-key":"goyal1997","container-title":"Journal of Economic Theory","DOI":"10.1006/jeth.1997.2315","ISSN":"0022-0531","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["1997"]]},"page":"34-57","source":"Scopus","title":"Non-exclusive conventions and social coordination","type":"article-journal","volume":"77"},
  {"id":"grafen2006","abstract":"The first fully explicit argument is given that broadly supports a widespread belief among whole-organism biologists that natural selection tends to lead to organisms acting as if maximizing their inclusive fitness. The use of optimization programs permits a clear statement of what this belief should be understood to mean, in contradistinction to the common mathematical presumption that it should be formalized as some kind of Lyapunov or even potential function. The argument reveals new details and uncovers latent assumptions. A very general genetic architecture is allowed, and there is arbitrary uncertainty. However, frequency dependence of fitnesses is not permitted. The logic of inclusive fitness immediately draws together various kinds of intra-genomic conflict, and the concept of ‘p-family’ is introduced. Inclusive fitness is thus incorporated into the formal Darwinism project, which aims to link the mathematics of motion (difference and differential equations) used to describe gene frequency trajectories with the mathematics of optimization used to describe purpose and design. Important questions remain to be answered in the fundamental theory of inclusive fitness.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",12,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Grafen","given":"Alan"}],"citation-key":"grafen2006","container-title":"Journal of Theoretical Biology","container-title-short":"Journal of Theoretical Biology","DOI":"10.1016/j.jtbi.2005.06.009","ISSN":"0022-5193","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2006",2,7]]},"language":"en","page":"541-563","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Optimization of inclusive fitness","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519305002559","volume":"238"},

  {"id":"greve2016","abstract":"In a theoretical framework of evolutionary developmental psychology, the present study investigates the assumption that free play during childhood is a condition for the development of individual adaptability, which in turn predicts, first, social success and, second, reproductive success. This hypothesis is tested in a study with 238 adults (75.9% females; 18–90 years). Participants were asked to recollect their free play experiences during childhood in detail, to report their current developmental status with respect to several aspects of social success, and to report the number of (own) children. Furthermore, individual adaptability (flexibility of goal adjustment) is assessed. Results show that the opportunity for free play in childhood significantly predicts both social success and individual adaptability. Social success did not predict reproductive success (number of offspring) directly. However, an indirect effect to the number of offspring was found, mediated by individual adaptability. These results suggest that freely playing in childhood is connected to the development of developmental resources, in particular individual adaptability in adulthood, which, in turn, is related to reproductive success (fitness).","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Greve","given":"Werner"},{"family":"Thomsen","given":"Tamara"}],"citation-key":"greve2016","container-title":"Evolutionary Psychology","container-title-short":"Evol Psychol","DOI":"10.1177/1474704916675349","ISSN":"1474-7049","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1474704916675349","publisher":"SAGE Publications Inc","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Evolutionary Advantages of Free Play During Childhood","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/1474704916675349","volume":"14"},

We review recent theories and empirical findings that aim at explaining why people follow norms even in private, when violations are difficult to detect and are not sanctioned. We discuss theories of norm internalization, social and self-image concerns, and social learning (i.e. preferences conditional on what others do/believe).

They could not communicate or see each other and thus had to accurately predict each other's choices to succeed. One division split the rewards evenly, while the others each favored one child. Five-year-olds mostly chose the division favorable to themselves, resulting in coordination failure. By contrast, 7-year-olds mostly coordinated successfully by choosing the division that split the rewards equally (even though they behaved selfishly in a control condition in which they could choose independently).

Druin posited a framework for thinking about the different methods of design for children, which also parallels history as one moves from the inside of the circle to the outer rim. In human-computer interaction (HCI), the role of user for children is historically the first role that children played in regard to the design of their technology. Practitioners of learner-centered design consider the act of learning as central to the technology itself and the design process.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Guha","given":"Mona Leigh"},{"family":"Fails","given":"Jerry Alan"}],"citation-key":"guha2018","container-title":"The Wiley Handbook of Human Computer Interaction","DOI":"10.1002/9781118976005.ch9","ISBN":"978-1-118-97600-5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","page":"171-189","publisher":"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","section":"9","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Kids and Design","type":"chapter","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/9781118976005.ch9"},

  {"id":"hacking1999","abstract":"Lost in the raging debate over the validity of social construction is the question of what, precisely, is being constructed. Facts, gender, quarks, reality? Is it a person? An object? An idea? A theory? Each entails a different notion of social construction, Ian Hacking reminds us. His book explores an array of examples to reveal the deep issues underlying contentious accounts of reality.Especially troublesome in this dispute is the status of the natural sciences, and this is where Hacking finds some of his most telling cases, from the conflict between biological and social approaches to mental illness to vying accounts of current research in sedimentary geology. He looks at the issue of child abuse--very much a reality, though the idea of child abuse is a social product. He also cautiously examines the ways in which advanced research on new weapons influences not the content but the form of science. In conclusion, Hacking comments on the \"culture wars\" in anthropology, in particular a spat between leading ethnographers over Hawaii and Captain Cook. Written with generosity and gentle wit by one of our most distinguished philosophers of science, this wise book brings a much needed measure of clarity to current arguments about the nature of knowledge.","author":[{"family":"Hacking","given":"Ian"}],"citation-key":"hacking1999","ISBN":"978-0-674-81200-0","issued":{"date-parts":[["1999"]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"280","publisher":"Harvard University Press","source":"Google Books","title":"The Social Construction of What?","type":"book"},
  {"id":"hale2020","abstract":"Conversation between two people involves subtle nonverbal coordination in addition to speech. However, the precise parameters and timing of this coordination remain unclear, which limits our ability to theorize about the neural and cognitive mechanisms of social coordination. In particular, it is unclear if conversation is dominated by synchronization (with no time lag), rapid and reactive mimicry (with lags under 1 s) or traditionally observed mimicry (with several seconds lag), each of which demands a different neural mechanism. Here we describe data from high-resolution motion capture of the head movements of pairs of participants (n = 31 dyads) engaged in structured conversations. In a pre-registered analysis pathway, we calculated the wavelet coherence of head motion within dyads as a measure of their nonverbal coordination and report two novel results. First, low-frequency coherence (0.2–1.1 Hz) is consistent with traditional observations of mimicry, and modeling shows this behavior is generated by a mechanism with a constant 600 ms lag between leader and follower. This is in line with rapid reactive (rather than predictive or memory-driven) models of mimicry behavior, and could be implemented in mirror neuron systems. Second, we find an unexpected pattern of lower-than-chance coherence between participants, or hypo-coherence, at high frequencies (2.6–6.5 Hz). Exploratory analyses show that this systematic decoupling is driven by fast nodding from the listening member of the dyad, and may be a newly identified social signal. These results provide a step towards the quantification of real-world human behavior in high resolution and provide new insights into the mechanisms of social coordination. © 2019, The Author(s).","archive":"Scopus","author":[{"family":"Hale","given":"J."},{"family":"Ward","given":"J.A."},{"family":"Buccheri","given":"F."},{"family":"Oliver","given":"D."},{"family":"Hamilton","given":"A.F.C."}],"citation-key":"hale2020","container-title":"Journal of Nonverbal Behavior","DOI":"10.1007/s10919-019-00320-3","ISSN":"0191-5886","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"page":"63-83","source":"Scopus","title":"Are You on My Wavelength?

  {"id":"hari2009","abstract":"Modern neuroimaging provides a common platform for neuroscience and related disciplines to explore the human brain, mind, and behavior. We base our review on the social shaping of the human mind and discuss various aspects of brain function related to social interaction. Despite private mental contents, people can share their understanding of the world using, beyond verbal communication, nonverbal cues such as gestures, facial expressions, and postures. The understanding of nonverbal messages is supported by the brain's mirroring systems that are shaped by individual experience. Within the organism-environment system, tight links exist between action and perception, both within an individual and between several individuals. Therefore, any comprehensive brain imaging study of the neuronal basis of social cognition requires appreciation of the situated and embodied nature of human cognition, motivating simultaneous monitoring of brain and bodily functions within a socially relevant environment. Because single-person studies alone cannot unravel the dynamic aspects of interpersonal interactions, it seems both necessary and beneficial to move towards “two-person neuroscience”; technological shortcomings and a limited conceptual framework have so far hampered such a leap. We conclude by discussing some major disorders of social interaction.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Hari","given":"Riitta"},{"family":"Kujala","given":"Miiamaaria V."}],"citation-key":"hari2009","container-title":"Physiological Reviews","DOI":"10.1152/physrev.00041.2007","ISSN":"0031-9333","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",4,1]]},"page":"453-479","publisher":"American Physiological Society","source":"journals.physiology.org (Atypon)","title":"Brain Basis of Human Social Interaction: From Concepts to Brain Imaging","title-short":"Brain Basis of Human Social Interaction","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00041.2007","volume":"89"},

  {"id":"harsanyi1967","abstract":"The paper develops a new theory for the analysis of games with incomplete information where the players are uncertain about some important parameters of the game situation, such as the payoff functions, the strategies available to various players, the information other players have about the game, etc. However, each player has a subjective probability distribution over the alternative possibilities.\n            In most of the paper it is assumed that these probability distributions entertained by the different players are mutually “consistent”, in the sense that they can be regarded as conditional probability distributions derived from a certain “basic probability distribution” over the parameters unknown to the various players. But later the theory is extended also to cases where the different players' subjective probability distributions fail to satisfy this consistency assumption.\n            In cases where the consistency assumption holds, the original game can be replaced by a game where nature first conducts a lottery in accordance with the basic probability distribution, and the outcome of this lottery will decide which particular subgame will be played, i.e., what the actual values of the relevant parameters will be in the game. Yet, each player will receive only partial information about the outcome of the lottery, and about the values of these parameters. However, every player will know the “basic probability distribution” governing the lottery. Thus, technically, the resulting game will be a game with complete information. It is called the Bayes-equivalent of the original game. Part I of the paper describes the basic model and discusses various intuitive interpretations for the latter. Part II shows that the Nash equilibrium points of the Bayes-equivalent game yield “Bayesian equilibrium points” for the original game.

  {"id":"harsanyi1988","abstract":"The authors, two of the most prominent game theorists of this generation, have devoted a number of years to the development of the theory presented here, and to its economic applications. They propose rational criteria for selecting one particular uniformly perfect equilibrium point as the solution of any noncooperative game. And, because any cooperative game can be remodelled as a noncooperative bargaining game, their theory defines a one-point solution for any cooperative game as well. By providing solutions - based on the same principles of rational behavior - for all classes of games, both cooperative and noncooperative, both those with complete and with incomplete information, Harsanyi and Selten's approach achieves a remarkable degree of theoretical unification for game theory as a whole and provides a deeper insight into the nature of game-theoretic rationality. The book applies this theory to a number of specific game classes, such as unanimity games; bargaining with transaction costs; trade involving one seller and several buyers; two-person bargaining with incomplete information on one side, and on both sides. The last chapter discusses the relationship of the authors' theory to other recently proposed solution concepts, particularly the Kohberg-Mertens stability theory.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Harsanyi","given":"John C."},{"family":"Selten","given":"Reinhard"}],"citation-key":"harsanyi1988","issued":{"date-parts":[["1988"]]},"language":"en","publisher":"The MIT Press","source":"ideas.repec.org","title":"A General Theory of Equilibrium Selection in Games","type":"book","URL":"https://ideas.repec.org/b/mtp/titles/0262582384.html","volume":"1"},

Hence, norms are shaped by complex cognitive processes involved in learning and social reasoning. At the population level, norms are influenced by intergenerational transmission and the structure of the social network.

Yet language use in a variable and non-stationary social environment requires linguistic representations to be flexible: old words acquire new ad hoc or partner-specific meanings on the fly. In this paper, we introduce CHAI (Continual Hierarchical Adaptation through Inference), a hierarchical Bayesian theory of coordination and convention formation that aims to reconcile the long-standing tension between these two basic observations. We argue that the central computational problem of communication is not simply transmission, as in classical formulations, but continual learning and adaptation over multiple timescales. Partner-specific common ground quickly emerges from social inferences within dyadic interactions, while community-wide social conventions are stable priors that have been abstracted away from interactions with multiple partners. We present new empirical data alongside simulations showing how our model provides a computational foundation for several phenomena that have posed a challenge for previous accounts: (1) the convergence to more efficient referring expressions across repeated interaction with the same partner, (2) the gradual transfer of partner-specific common ground to strangers, and (3) the influence of communicative context on which conventions eventually form.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",11,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Hawkins","given":"Robert D."},{"family":"Franke","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Frank","given":"Michael C."},{"family":"Goldberg","given":"Adele E."},{"family":"Smith","given":"Kenny"},{"family":"Griffiths","given":"Thomas L."},{"family":"Goodman","given":"Noah D."}],"citation-key":"hawkins2021","container-title":"arXiv:2104.05857 [cs]","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,27]]},"source":"arXiv.org","title":"From partners to populations: A hierarchical Bayesian account of coordination and convention","title-short":"From partners to populations","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.05857"},

Institutions are formalized as epistemic games where the players share some forms of practical reasoning. An institution is a rule-governed game satisfying three conditions: common understanding, minimal awareness and minimal practical rationality.

  {"id":"hedoin2021","abstract":"This paper pursues a naturalist endeavor in social ontology by arguing that the Beliefs-Rules-Equilibrium account of institutions can help to advance the debate over the nature of social kinds. This account of institutions emerges from a growing number of works in economics that use game theory to study the role and the functioning of institutions in human societies. I intend to show how recent developments in the economic analysis of rules and institutions can help solve issues that are generally considered constitutive of any ontological inquiry. I argue that the Beliefs-Rules-Equilibrium account of institutions can contribute to advancing the debate on an issue of particular importance, regarding the specific form of dependence characterizing the relation between institutions and individuals’ attitudes about them. I tackle this issue by taking Francesco Guala's claims about the nature of institutions made in his book “Understanding Institutions” as a point of departure. In particular, I reject Guala’s functionalism about institutions. On the basis of the Beliefs-Rules-Equilibrium account, I claim that it is futile to search for constitutive features of general institutions (money, property rights, family…) and that the best we can have is a knowledge of what are the rules within a specific institution, which the agents consider to be essential in their institutional practice.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",1,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Hédoin","given":"Cyril"}],"citation-key":"hedoin2021","container-title":"Journal of Social Ontology","DOI":"10.1515/jso-2020-0001","ISSN":"2196-9663","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",2,1]]},"language":"en","page":"73-96","publisher":"De Gruyter","source":"www.degruyter.com","title":"The Beliefs-Rules-Equilibrium Account of Institutions: A Contribution to a Naturalistic Social Ontology","title-short":"The Beliefs-Rules-Equilibrium Account of Institutions","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/jso-2020-0001/html","volume":"7"},

  {"id":"heintz2021","abstract":"This work identifies distinctive features of the authors&#39; species&#39; social ecology to explain how and why humans, and only humans, evolved the cognitive capacities that, in turn, lead to massive diversity and open-endedness in means and modes of expression. Abstract Human expression is open-ended, versatile, and diverse, ranging from ordinary language use to painting, from exaggerated displays of affection to micro-movements that aid coordination. Here we present and defend the claim that this expressive diversity is united by an interrelated suite of cognitive capacities, the evolved functions of which are the expression and recognition of informative intentions. We describe how evolutionary dynamics normally leash communication to narrow domains of statistical mutual benefit, and how expression is unleashed in humans. The relevant cognitive capacities are cognitive adaptations to living in a partner choice social ecology; and they are, correspondingly, part of the ordinarily developing human cognitive phenotype, emerging early and reliably in ontogeny. In other words, we identify distinctive features of our species&#39; social ecology to explain how and why humans, and only humans, evolved the cognitive capacities that, in turn, lead to massive diversity and open-endedness in means and modes of expression. Language use is but one of these modes of expression, albeit one of manifestly high importance. We make cross-species comparisons, describe how the relevant cognitive capacities can evolve in a gradual manner, and survey how unleashed expression facilitates not only language use, but also novel behaviour in many other domains too, focusing on the examples of joint action, teaching, punishment, and art, all of which are ubiquitous in human societies but relatively rare in other species. Much of this diversity derives from graded aspects of human expression, which can be used to satisfy informative intentions in creative and new ways. We aim to help reorient cognitive pragmatics, as a phenomenon that is not a supplement to linguistic communication and on the periphery of language science, but rather the foundation of the many of the most distinctive features of human behaviour, society, and culture.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Heintz","given":"C."},{"family":"Scott-Phillips","given":"T."}],"citation-key":"heintz2021","container-title":"Behavioral and Brain Sciences","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"language":"en","source":"www.semanticscholar.org","title":"Expression unleashed: The evolutionary and cognitive foundations of human communication","title-short":"Expression unleashed","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Expression-unleashed%3A-The-evolutionary-and-of-human-Heintz-Scott-Phillips/912a0052fde1c88e0f3a1941d1e72ef413263a57"},

What accounts for our capacity to understand the way the physical world works, to think ourselves into the minds of others, to gossip, read, tell stories about the past, and imagine the future? These questions are not new: they have been debated by philosophers, psychologists, anthropologists, evolutionists, and neurobiologists over the course of centuries. One explanation widely accepted today is that humans have special cognitive instincts. Unlike other living animal species, we are born with complicated mechanisms for reasoning about causation, reading the minds of others, copying behaviors, and using language. Cecilia Heyes agrees that adult humans have impressive pieces of cognitive equipment. In her framing, however, these cognitive gadgets are not instincts programmed in the genes but are constructed in the course of childhood through social interaction. Cognitive gadgets are products of cultural evolution, rather than genetic evolution. At birth, the minds of human babies are only subtly different from the minds of newborn chimpanzees. We are friendlier, our attention is drawn to different things, and we have a capacity to learn and remember that outstrips the abilities of newborn chimpanzees. Yet when these subtle differences are exposed to culture-soaked human environments, they have enormous effects. They enable us to upload distinctively human ways of thinking from the social world around us. As Cognitive Gadgets makes clear, from birth our malleable human minds can learn through culture not only what to think but how to think it.--","author":[{"family":"Heyes","given":"Cecilia M."}],"call-number":"BF311 .H46916 2018","citation-key":"heyes2018","event-place":"Cambridge, Massachusetts","ISBN":"978-0-674-98015-0","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"292","publisher":"The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press","publisher-place":"Cambridge, Massachusetts","source":"Library of Congress ISBN","title":"Cognitive gadgets: the cultural evolution of thinking","title-short":"Cognitive gadgets","type":"book"},

In this paper I argue that a significant class of social entities also presents us with an ontological puzzle that has thus far not been addressed satisfactorily. This puzzle relates to the location of certain social entities. Where, for instance, are organizations located? Where their members are, or where their designated ofﬁces are? Organizations depend on their members for their existence, but the members of an organization can be where the organization is not. The designated ofﬁce of an organization, however, need be little more than a mailbox. I argue that the problem can be solved by conceptualizing the relation between social entities and non-social entities as one of constitution, a relation of unity without identity. Constituted objects have properties that cannot be reduced to properties of the constituting objects. Thus, my attempt to solve the Location Problem results in an argument in favor of a kind of non-reductive materialism about the social.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",11,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Hindriks","given":"Frank"}],"citation-key":"hindriks2013","container-title":"Synthese","container-title-short":"Synthese","DOI":"10.1007/s11229-011-0036-0","ISSN":"0039-7857, 1573-0964","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",2]]},"language":"en","page":"413-437","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The location problem in social ontology","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11229-011-0036-0","volume":"190"},

To capture this discrepancy, I present a hybrid theory, the Rules-and-Equilibria Theory. According to this theory, institutions are rule-governed behavioural regularities. The Rules-and-Equilibria Theory provides the basis for two measures of institutional strength. First, institutions that pertain to coordination games solve problems of information.

This also empowers the person whose behavior is being observed: By intelligently modifying her actions, she can inﬂuence the mental representations that an observer ascribes to her, and by extension, what the observer comes to believe about the world. That is, she can engage in intentionally communicative demonstrations. Here, we develop a computational account of generating and interpreting communicative demonstrations by explicitly distinguishing between two interacting types of planning. Typically, instrumental planning aims to control states of the environment, whereas belief-directed planning aims to inﬂuence an observer’s mental representations. Our framework extends existing formal models of pragmatics and pedagogy to the setting of value-guided decision-making, captures how people modify their intentional behavior to show what they know about the reward or causal structure of an environment, and helps explain data on infant and child imitation in terms of literal versus pragmatic interpretation of adult demonstrators’ actions. Additionally, our analysis of belief-directed intentionality and mentalizing sheds light on the socio-cognitive mechanisms that underlie distinctly human forms of communication, culture, and sociality.","author":[{"family":"Ho","given":"Mark K"}],"citation-key":"ho","language":"en","page":"79","source":"Zotero","title":"Planning and Interpreting Communicative Demonstrations","type":"article-journal"},

This framework combines three elements that, considered jointly, may enable a more precise prediction of self-control outcomes than they do when studied in isolation: impulsive precursors of behavior, reflective precursors, and situational or dispositional boundary conditions.

These worries, in effect, hold that the questions that metaphysics tries to answer have long been answered in other parts of inquiry, ones that have much greater authority. And if they haven’t been answered yet then one should not look to philosophy for an answer. What metaphysics tries to do has been or will be done by the sciences. There is nothing left to do for philosophy, or so the worry. Let me illustrate this with two examples, one of which is our main concern here. 1.1 Two Examples The most striking examples where it seems that the question metaphysics tries to answer has been answered long ago outside of philosophy are examples from ontology. These will be our main concern in this paper. One of the central questions in the philosophy of mathematics is an ontological question: are there any mathematical objects? If there are then a certain story of mathematical truth and objectivity will have to be told, and if there are not then a completely different one has to be right. This is supposed to be a large-scale philosophical question about mathematics. It’s the question whether or not there are math-ematical objects. But it seems that this question is not a philosophical question at all. It is one that is easily answered within mathematics.

  {"id":"hohwy2021","abstract":"The free energy principle says that any self-organising system that is at nonequilibrium steady-state with its environment must minimize its (variational) free energy. It is proposed as a grand unifying principle for cognitive science and biology. The principle can appear cryptic, esoteric, too ambitious, and unfalsifiable—suggesting it would be best to suspend any belief in the principle, and instead focus on individual, more concrete and falsifiable ‘process theories’ for particular biological processes and phenomena like perception, decision and action. Here, I explain the free energy principle, and I argue that it is best understood as offering a conceptual and mathematical analysis of the concept of existence of self-organising systems. This analysis offers a new type of solution to long-standing problems in neurobiology, cognitive science, machine learning and philosophy concerning the possibility of normatively constrained, self-supervised learning and inference. The principle can therefore uniquely serve as a regulatory principle for process theories, to ensure that process theories conforming to it enable self-supervision. This is, at least for those who believe self-supervision is a foundational explanatory task, good reason to believe the free energy principle.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Hohwy","given":"Jakob"}],"citation-key":"hohwy2021","container-title":"Synthese","container-title-short":"Synthese","DOI":"10.1007/s11229-020-02622-2","ISSN":"1573-0964","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"29-53","source":"Springer Link","title":"Self-supervision, normativity and the free energy principle","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11229-020-02622-2","volume":"199"},

After showing how mathematics can play either a representational or an explanatory role by considering two alternative explanations of a same biological pattern—“Bergmann’s rule”—I offer an example of an explanation where the bulk of the explanatory job is done by a mathematical theorem, and where mechanisms involved in the target systems are not explanatorily relevant. Then I account for the way mathematical properties may function in an explanatory way within an explanation by arguing that some mathematical propositions involving variables non directly referring to the target system features constitute constraints to which a whole class of systems should comply, provided they are describable by a mathematical object concerned by those propositions. According to such “constraint account”, those mathematical facts are directly entailing the explanandum (often a limit regime, a robustness property or a steady state), as a consequence of such constraints. I call those explanations “structural”, because here properties of mathematical structures are accounting for the explanandum; various kinds of mathematical structures (algebraic, graph-theoretical, etc.) thereby define various types of structural explanations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",11,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Huneman","given":"Philippe"}],"citation-key":"huneman2018","container-title":"Philosophical Studies","container-title-short":"Philos Stud","DOI":"10.1007/s11098-017-0887-4","ISSN":"1573-0883","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",3,1]]},"language":"en","page":"665-702","source":"Springer Link","title":"Outlines of a theory of structural explanations","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11098-017-0887-4","volume":"175"},

This paper argues that it can’t—or at least not so long as it sticks with the cognitivist rendering that Clark (2016) and others favor. In making this case the argument of this paper unfolds as follows: Sect. 1 describes the basics of PPC—its attachment to the idea that we perceive the world by guessing the world. It then details the reasons why so many find cognitivist interpretations to be inevitable. Section 2 examines how prominent proponents of cognitivist PPC have proposed dealing with a fundamental problem that troubles their accounts—the question of how the brain is able to get into the great guessing game in the first place. It is argued that on close inspection Clark’s (2016) solution, which he calls bootstrap heaven is—once we take a realistic look at the situation of the brain—in fact bootstrap hell.

Some laws are fundamental in the sense that they are the result of inductive generalisations of observed regularities and at the same time in their formulation contain a new theoretical predicate. The inductive generalisations simultaneously function as implicit definitions of these new predicates. Other laws are either explicit definitions or consequences of other previously established laws. I discuss the laws of classical mechanics, relativity theory and electromagnetism in detail. Laws are necessary, whereas accidental generalisations are not. But necessity here is not a modal concept, but rather interpreted as short for the semantic predicate “... is necessarily true”. Thus no modal logic is needed. The necessity attributed to law sentences is in turn interpreted as “necessary condition for the rest of the theory”, which is true since fundamental laws are implicit definitions of theoretical predicates use in the theory.</p>","author":[{"family":"Johansson","given":"Lars-Göran"}],"citation-key":"johansson","container-title":"Theoria","DOI":"10.1111/theo.12176","title":"An Empiricist View on Laws, Quantities and Physical Necessity","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/theo.12176?af=R"},

I first revisit Robert K.

Drawing on Merton's ideas on theorizing and recent discussions on mechanism‐based explanations, I argue that this tension can be resolved by decomposing a middle‐range theory into three interrelated and evolving components that perform different functions in sociological research: (i) a conceptual framework about social phenomena that is a set of interrelated concepts that evolve in close connection with empirical analysis; (ii) a mechanism schema that is an abstract and incomplete description of a social mechanism; and (iii) a cluster of all mechanism‐based explanations of social phenomena that are based on the particular mechanism schema. I show how these components develop over time and how they serve different functions in sociological theorizing and research.

  {"id":"kangasrääsiö2019","abstract":"This paper addresses a common challenge with computational cognitive models: identifying parameter values that are both theoretically plausible and generate predictions that match well with empirical data. While computational models can offer deep explanations of cognition, they are computationally complex and often out of reach of traditional parameter fitting methods. Weak methodology may lead to premature rejection of valid models or to acceptance of models that might otherwise be falsified. Mathematically robust fitting methods are, therefore, essential to the progress of computational modeling in cognitive science. In this article, we investigate the capability and role of modern fitting methods—including Bayesian optimization and approximate Bayesian computation—and contrast them to some more commonly used methods: grid search and Nelder–Mead optimization. Our investigation consists of a reanalysis of the fitting of two previous computational models: an Adaptive Control of Thought—Rational model of skill acquisition and a computational rationality model of visual search. The results contrast the efficiency and informativeness of the methods. A key advantage of the Bayesian methods is the ability to estimate the uncertainty of fitted parameter values. We conclude that approximate Bayesian computation is (a) efficient, (b) informative, and (c) offers a path to reproducible results.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Kangasrääsiö","given":"Antti"},{"family":"Jokinen","given":"Jussi P.

  {"id":"kauffman1993","abstract":"Stuart Kauffman here presents a brilliant new paradigm for evolutionary biology, one that extends the basic concepts of Darwinian evolution to accommodate recent findings and perspectives from the fields of biology, physics, chemistry and mathematics. The book drives to the heart of the exciting debate on the origins of life and maintenance of order in complex biological systems. It focuses on the concept of self-organization: the spontaneous emergence of order that is widely observed throughout nature Kauffman argues that self-organization plays an important role in the Darwinian process of natural selection. Yet until now no systematic effort has been made to incorporate the concept of self-organization into evolutionary theory. The construction requirements which permit complex systems to adapt are poorly understood, as is the extent to which selection itself can yield systems able to adapt more successfully. This book explores these themes. It shows how complex systems, contrary to expectations, can spontaneously exhibit stunning degrees of order, and how this order, in turn, is essential for understanding the emergence and development of life on Earth. Topics include the new biotechnology of applied molecular evolution, with its important implications for developing new drugs and vaccines; the balance between order and chaos observed in many naturally occurring systems; new insights concerning the predictive power of statistical mechanics in biology; and other major issues. Indeed, the approaches investigated here may prove to be the new center around which biological science itself will evolve. The work is written for all those interested in the cutting edge of research in the life sciences.","author":[{"family":"Kauffman","given":"Stuart A."},{"family":"Kauffman","given":"Member of the Santa Fe Institute and Professor of Biochemistry Stuart A."}],"citation-key":"kauffman1993","ISBN":"978-0-19-507951-7","issued":{"date-parts":[["1993"]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"744","publisher":"Oxford University Press","source":"Google Books","title":"The Origins of Order: Self-organization and Selection in Evolution","title-short":"The Origins of Order","type":"book"},

In this paper we present a method for automatically identifying the current set of shared beliefs and ``questions under discussion'' (QUDs) of a group with a shared goal. We annotate a dataset of multimodal interactions in a shared physical space with speech transcriptions, prosodic features, gestures, actions, and facets of collaboration, and operationalize these features for use in a deep neural model to predict moves toward construction of common ground. Model outputs cascade into a set of formal closure rules derived from situated evidence and belief axioms and update operations.

Experiment 1 investigated how different note-taking formats in combination with review activities affect recall and relational learning. During a 19-min lecture, participants either took notes in their conventional manner, on an outline framework, or on a matrix framework. Following the lecture, approximately half of the participants in each note-taking group prepared for performance tests by using their notes to write a comparative essay about the lecture topics. The others reviewed notes in their standard manner. Results indicated that essay writing was less effective than standard review practices for relational learning and that note-taking on an outline increased test performance beyond other note formats. Performance differences might have resulted from quantitative differences in note-taking favoring outline note-takers. Experiment 2 reexamined whether various note-taking formats influence student note-taking. Students recorded lecture notes on various outline or matrix frameworks or without aid in their conventional manner.

The model predicts that “parity promotes peace”: in the pure-strategy equilibrium, agents with relatively symmetric conflict capabilities agree to resolve the conflict by using a random device; however, with sufficiently asymmetric capabilities, conflicts are unavoidable because the stronger agent prefers to fight.

  {"id":"kiverstein","abstract":"Cognition has traditionally been understood in terms of internal mental representations, and computational operations carried out on internal mental representations. Radical approaches propose to reconceive cognition in terms of agent-environment dynamics. An outstanding challenge for such a philosophical project is how to scale-up from perception and action to cases of what is typically called 'higher-order' cognition such as linguistic thought, the case we focus on in this paper. Perception and action are naturally described in terms of agent-environment dynamics, but can a person's thoughts about absent, abstract or counterfactual states of affairs also be accounted for in such terms? We argue such a question will seem pressing so long as one fails to appreciate how richly resourceful the human ecological niche is in terms of the affordances it provides. The explanatory work that is supposedly done by mental representations in a philosophical analysis of cognition, can instead be done by looking outside of the head to the environment structured by sociomaterial practices, and the affordances it makes available. Once one recognizes how much of the human ecological niche has become structured by activities of talking and writing, this should take away at least some of the motivation for understanding linguistic thinking in terms of content-bearing internal representations. We'll argue that people can think about absent, abstract or counterfactual because of their skills for engaging with what we will call \"enlanguaged affordances\". We make use of the phenomenological analysis of speech in Merleau-Ponty to show how the multiple affordances an individual is ready to engage with in a particular situation will typically include enlanguaged affordances.","author":[{"family":"Kiverstein","given":"Julian"},{"family":"Rietveld","given":"Erik"}],"citation-key":"kiverstein","container-title":"Synthese","DOI":"10.1007/s11229-020-02540-3","title":"Scaling-up skilled intentionality to linguistic thought","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11229-020-02540-3?utm_source=researcher_app&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=RESR_MRKT_Researcher_inbound"},

There are two philosophical interpretations of this picture. A computationalist will argue that as FEP claims that Bayesian inference underpins both perception and action, it entails a concept of cognition as a computational process. An enactivist, on the other hand, will point out that FEP explains cognitive systems as constantly self-organizing to non-equilibrium steady-state.

We recorded EEG from an observer monitoring two individuals who were occasionally communicating with each other via either mutual eye contact and/or pointing gestures, and then jointly attending to the same object or attending to different objects that were placed on a table in front of them. The analyses were focussed on the processing of the interaction outcome (i.e. presence or absence of joint attention) and showed that its interpretation is a two-stage process, as reflected in the N300 and the N400 potentials. The N300 amplitude was reduced when the two individuals shared their focus of attention, which indicates the operation of a cognitive process that involves the relatively fast identification and evaluation of actor–object relationships. On the other hand, the N400 was insensitive to the sharing or distribution of the two individuals’ attentional focus. Interestingly, the N400 was reduced when the interaction outcome was preceded either by mutual eye contact or by a perceived pointing gesture. This shows that observation of communication “opens up” the mind to a wider range of action possibilities and thereby helps to interpret unusual outcomes of social interactions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Kourtis","given":"Dimitrios"},{"family":"Jacob","given":"Pierre"},{"family":"Sebanz","given":"Natalie"},{"family":"Sperber","given":"Dan"},{"family":"Knoblich","given":"Günther"}],"citation-key":"kourtis2020","container-title":"Scientific Reports","container-title-short":"Sci Rep","DOI":"10.1038/s41598-020-75283-3","ISSN":"2045-2322","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",12]]},"language":"en","page":"18135","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Making sense of human interaction benefits from communicative cues","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-75283-3","volume":"10"},

Play primarily affords juveniles practice toward the exercise of later skills. Its benefits exceed its costs when sufficient practice would otherwise be unlikely or unsafe, as is particularly true with physical skills and socially competitive ones. Manipulative play with objects is a byproduct of increased intelligence, specifically selected for only in a few advanced primates, notably the chimpanzee.The adaptiveness of play in pongid evolution is traced through the probable changes in selective pressures that occurred in hominid evolution. It is argued that fantasy was an emergent property in hominids, made possible by symbolic intelligence and language, and serving to make play complex enough to continue to provide useful practice for increasingly complex later skills.The advent of organised instruction and education has meant that play's unplanned, intrinisic goal-setting could be replaced by extrinsic goal-setting in the systematic development of particular skills. However, the need to ensure adequate motivation has continued to give play educational value.

In 2018, the U.S. National toxicology program reported, two year toxicological studies for potential health hazards from exposure to cell phone radiations. Epigenetic modulations play a critical regulatory role in many cellular functions and pathological conditions. In this study, we assessed the dose-dependent and frequency-dependent epigenetic modulation (DNA and Histone methylation) in the hippocampus of Wistar rats. A Total of 96 male Wistar rats were segregated into 12 groups exposed to 900 MHz, 1800 MHz and 2450 MHz RF-MW at a specific absorption rate (SAR) of 5.84 × 10⁻⁴ W/kg, 5.94 × 10⁻⁴ W/kg and 6.4 × 10⁻⁴ W/kg respectively for 2 h per day for 1-month, 3-month and 6-month periods. At the end of the exposure duration, animals were sacrificed to collect the hippocampus. Global hippocampal DNA methylation and histone methylation were estimated by ELISA. However, DNA methylating enzymes, DNA methyltransferase1 (DNMT1) and histone methylating enzymes euchromatic histone methylthransferase1 (EHMT1) expression was evaluated by real-time PCR, as well as further validated with Western blot. Alteration in epigenetic modulation was observed in the hippocampus. Global DNA methylation was decreased and histone methylation was increased in the hippocampus. We observed that microwave exposure led to significant epigenetic modulations in the hippocampus with increasing frequency and duration of exposure. Microwave exposure with increasing frequency and exposure duration brings significant (p < 0.05) epigenetic modulations which alters gene expression in the hippocampus.","author":[{"family":"Kumar","given":"Ranjeet"},{"family":"Deshmukh","given":"Pravin"},{"family":"Sharma","given":"Sonal"},{"family":"Banerjee","given":"Basu"}],"citation-key":"kumar2021","container-title":"Environmental Research","container-title-short":"Environmental Research","DOI":"10.1016/j.envres.2020.110297","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",1,1]]},"page":"110297","source":"ResearchGate","title":"Effect of mobile phone signal radiation on epigenetic modulation in the hippocampus of Wistar rat","type":"article-journal","volume":"192"},

  {"id":"lacroix2019","abstract":"Significant advances have been made in artificial systems by using biological systems as a guide. However, there is often little interaction between computational models for emergent communication and biological models of the emergence of language. Many researchers in language origins and emergent communication take compositionality as their primary target for explaining how simple communication systems can become more like natural language. However, there is reason to think that compositionality is the wrong target on the biological side, and so too the wrong target on the machine-learning side. As such, the purpose of this paper is to explore this claim. This has theoretical implications for language origins research more generally, but the focus here will be the implications for research on emergent communication in computer science and machine learning---specifically regarding the types of programmes that might be expected to work and those which will not. I further suggest an alternative approach for future research which focuses on reflexivity, rather than compositionality, as a target for explaining how simple communication systems may become more like natural language. I end by providing some reference to the language origins literature that may be of some use to researchers in machine learning.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,14]]},"author":[{"family":"LaCroix","given":"Travis"}],"citation-key":"lacroix2019","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.1911.11668","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",12,27]]},"number":"arXiv:1911.11668","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Biology and Compositionality: Empirical Considerations for Emergent-Communication Protocols","title-short":"Biology and Compositionality","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.11668"},

In Lewis’ (Convention, Blackwell, Oxford, 1969) conception of a signaling game, salience is offered as an explanation for how individuals may come to agree upon a linguistic convention. Skyrms (Signals: evolution, learning & information, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2010a) offers a dynamic explanation of how signaling conventions might arise presupposing no salience whatsoever. The extension of the atomic signaling game examined here—which I will refer to as a salience game—introduces a variable parameter into the atomic signaling game which allows for degrees of salience, thus ﬁlling in the continuum between Skyrms’ and Lewis’ models. The model does not presuppose any salience at the outset, but illustrates a process by which accidentally evolved salience is ampliﬁed, to the beneﬁt of the players. It is shown that increasing degrees of salience allow populations to avoid sub-optimal pooling equilibria and to coordinate upon conventions more quickly.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",1,12]]},"author":[{"family":"LaCroix","given":"Travis"}],"citation-key":"lacroix2020a","container-title":"Synthese","container-title-short":"Synthese","DOI":"10.1007/s11229-018-1766-z","ISSN":"0039-7857, 1573-0964","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",4]]},"language":"en","page":"1725-1747","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"On salience and signaling in sender–receiver games: partial pooling, learning, and focal points","title-short":"On salience and signaling in sender–receiver games","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11229-018-1766-z","volume":"197"},

In addition to showing how recent metaphysics has drifted away from connection with all other serious scholarly inquiry as a result of not heeding this restriction, they demonstrate how to build a metaphysics compatible with current fundamental physics ('ontic structural realism'), which, when combined with their metaphysics of the special sciences ('rainforest realism'), can be used to unify physics with the other sciences without reducing these sciences to physics itself. Taking science metaphysically seriously, Ladyman and Ross argue, means that metaphysicians must abandon the picture of the world as composed of self-subsistent individual objects, and the paradigm of causation as the collision of such objects. Every Thing Must Go also assesses the role of information theory and complex systems theory in attempts to explain the relationship between the special sciences and physics, treading a middle road between the grand synthesis of thermodynamics and information, and eliminativism about information. The consequences of the author's metaphysical theory for central issues in the philosophy of science are explored, including the implications for the realism vs. empiricism debate, the role of causation in scientific explanations, the nature of causation and laws, the status of abstract and virtual objects, and the objective reality of natural kinds.","author":[{"family":"Ladyman","given":"James"},{"family":"Ross","given":"Don"},{"family":"Spurrett","given":"David"},{"family":"Collier","given":"John"}],"citation-key":"ladyman2007","ISBN":"978-0-19-153475-1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007",7,5]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"359","publisher":"OUP Oxford","source":"Google Books","title":"Every Thing Must Go: Metaphysics Naturalized","title-short":"Every Thing Must Go","type":"book"},
  {"id":"ladyman2013","abstract":"Complex systems research is becoming ever more important in both the natural and social sciences. It is commonly implied that there is such a thing as a complex system, different examples of which are studied across many disciplines. However, there is no concise definition of a complex system, let alone a definition on which all scientists agree. We review various attempts to characterize a complex system, and consider a core set of features that are widely associated with complex systems in the literature and by those in the field. We argue that some of these features are neither necessary nor sufficient for complexity, and that some of them are too vague or confused to be of any analytical use. In order to bring mathematical rigour to the issue we then review some standard measures of complexity from the scientific literature, and offer a taxonomy for them, before arguing that the one that best captures the qualitative notion of the order produced by complex systems is that of the Statistical Complexity. Finally, we offer our own list of necessary conditions as a characterization of complexity. These conditions are qualitative and may not be jointly sufficient for complexity.

Its controversial argument is radical, and at times, even revolutionary. John Law argues that methods don't just describe social realities but are also involved in creating them. The implications of this argument are highly significant, as if this is the case, methods are always political, and it raises the question of what kinds of social realities we want to create. Most current methods look for clarity and precision. It is usually said that only poor research produces messy findings, and the idea that things in the world might be fluid, elusive, or multiple is unthinkable. Law's startling argument is that this is wrong and it is time for a new approach. Many realities, he says, are vague and ephemeral. If methods want to know and to help to shape the world, then they need to reinvent themselves and their politics to deal with mess. That is thechallenge. Nothing less will do.

Second, decision makers may have preferences regarding consequences to other individuals and therefore choose their actions to improve or reduce the well-being of others. Many neurobiological studies have exploited game theory to probe the neural basis of decision making and suggested that these features of social decision making might be reflected in the functions of brain areas involved in reward evaluation and reinforcement learning.

Everyday social interactions can have a similar payoff structure (with emotional rather than legal penalties) whenever a request is implicitly forbidden by the relational model holding between speaker and hearer (e.g., bribing an honest maitre d’, where the reciprocity of the bribe clashes with his authority). Even when a hearer’s willingness is known, indirect speech offers higher-order plausible deniability by preempting certainty, gossip, and common knowledge of the request. In supporting experiments, participants judged the intentions and reactions of characters in scenarios that involved fraught requests varying in politeness and directness.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",5,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Lee","given":"James J."},{"family":"Pinker","given":"Steven"}],"citation-key":"lee2010","container-title":"Psychological Review","container-title-short":"Psychological Review","DOI":"10.1037/a0019688","ISSN":"1939-1471, 0033-295X","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010"]]},"language":"en","page":"785-807","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Rationales for indirect speech: The theory of the strategic speaker.","title-short":"Rationales for indirect speech","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/a0019688","volume":"117"},
  {"id":"lee2023","abstract":"Adaptation to changing environments is a universal feature of life and can involve the organism modifying itself in response to the environment as well as actively modifying the environment to control selection pressures. The latter case couples the organism to environment. Then, how quickly should the organism change in response to the environment? We formulate this question in terms of how memory duration scales with environmental rate of change when there are trade-offs in remembering vs. forgetting. We derive a universal scaling law for optimal memory duration, taking into account memory precision as well as two components of environmental volatility, bias and stability. We find sublinear scaling with any amount of environmental volatility. We use a memory complexity measure to explore the strategic conditions (game dynamics) favoring actively reducing environmental volatility—outsourcing memory through niche construction—over investing in neural tissue. We predict stabilizing niche construction will evolve when neural tissue is costly, the environment is variable, and it is beneficial to be able to encode a rich repertoire of environmental states.\nSignificance Statement All organisms must adapt to changing environments, but adaptation can modify the environment itself. We solve a version of this problem in terms of how long organisms remember. Shorter memory should be better for variable environments and longer for slow changing ones, but environmental variability depends on feedback. Surprisingly, we find the same mathematical law in both cases, revealing how much shorter memory should be relative to the environmental timescale. We consider how this depends on memory complexity and metabolic costs in populations, allowing us to predict a general set of conditions for when organism will outsource memory to the environment: when maintaining a brain is costly, the environment fluctuates quickly, and organisms inhabit a complex environment.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Lee","given":"Edward D."},{"family":"Flack","given":"Jessica C."},{"family":"Krakauer","given":"David C."}],"citation-key":"lee2023","DOI":"10.1101/2022.09.01.506204","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,8]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2023, Posted by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.

Meaning is provided to events from the perspective of hindsight, but with reference to horizons of meaning. Whereas “natural selection” is based on genotypes that are observable (like DNA), cultural selection mechanisms are not hard-wired, but evolve. The “genotypes” of cultural evolution are codes in the communication which can operate as selections upon one another. Local instantiations shape trajectories; regimes operate as selection pressure with reference to the next-order horizons of meaning. These orders of expectations can operate incursively and hyper-incursively against the arrow of time and thus generate redundancies: (i) horizons of meaning can be expected to overlap and (ii) distinctions generate new options enlarging the maximum capacities. Information theory and the theory of anticipatory systems can be used for the elaboration of operations against the arrow of time. New options can be a synergetic effect of interactions among codes in the communication and serve as sources of wealth in a knowledge-based economy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Leydesdorff","given":"Loet"},{"family":"Hoegl","given":"Franz"}],"citation-key":"leydesdorff2020","container-title":"Biosystems","container-title-short":"Biosystems","DOI":"10.1016/j.biosystems.2020.104236","ISSN":"0303-2647","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"104236","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"The evolutionary dynamics of expectations: Interactions among codes in inter-human communications","title-short":"The evolutionary dynamics of expectations","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0303264720301258","volume":"198"},

This review examines four broad areas of research within social cognitive neuroscience: (a) understanding others, (b) understanding oneself, (c) controlling oneself, and (d ) the processes that occur at the interface of self and others. In addition, this review highlights two core-processing distinctions that can be neurocognitively identiﬁed across all of these domains. The distinction between automatic versus controlled processes has long been important to social psychological theory and can be dissociated in the neural regions contributing to social cognition. Alternatively, the differentiation between internally-focused processes that focus on one’s own or another’s mental interior and externally-focused processes that focus on one’s own or another’s visible features and actions is a new distinction. This latter distinction emerges from social cognitive neuroscience investigations rather than from existing psychological theories demonstrating that social cognitive neuroscience can both draw on and contribute to social psychological theory.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Lieberman","given":"Matthew D."}],"citation-key":"lieberman2007","container-title":"Annual Review of Psychology","container-title-short":"Annu.

We argue that the key is to distinguish the general DPF from more specific applications to particular domains, which we refer to as dual process models (DPMs). We show how different DPMs can be applied to a variety of analytically distinct issues of interest to cultural sociologists beyond specific issues related to morality, such as culture in learning, culture in memory, culture in thinking, and culture in acting processes.

I then further deploy that scientific metaphysics to propose a contingently grounded semi-formal approach, with set theoretic features, and then with information theoretic features, to provide a way of assessing when a scientific theory and its ontology are aligned with OR appropriately in the context of the proposed scientific metaphysics.","author":[{"family":"Long","given":"Bruce"}],"citation-key":"long","container-title":"Axiomathes","DOI":"10.1007/s10516-019-09430-5","title":"A Scientific Metaphysics and Ockham's Razor","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10516-019-09430-5?utm_source=researcher_app&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=RESR_MRKT_Researcher_inbound"},
  {"id":"lopez-rubio","abstract":"In the last few years, biologists and computer scientists have claimed that the introduction of data science techniques in molecular biology has changed the characteristics and the aims of typical outputs (i.e. models) of such a discipline. In this paper we will critically examine this claim. First, we identify the received view on models and their aims in molecular biology. Models in molecular biology are mechanistic and explanatory. Next, we identify the scope and aims of data science (machine learning in particular). These lie mainly in the creation of predictive models which performances increase as data set increases. Next, we will identify a tradeoff between predictive and explanatory performances by comparing the features of mechanistic and predictive models. Finally, we show how this a priori analysis of machine learning and mechanistic research applies to actual biological practice. This will be done by analyzing the publications of a consortium—The Cancer Genome Atlas—which stands at the forefront in integrating data science and molecular biology. The result will be that biologists have to deal with the tradeoff between explaining and predicting that we have identified, and hence the explanatory force of the 'new' biology is substantially diminished if compared to the 'old' biology. However, this aspect also emphasizes the existence of other research goals which make predictive force independent from explanation.","author":[{"family":"López-Rubio","given":"Ezequiel"},{"family":"Ratti","given":"Emanuele"}],"citation-key":"lopez-rubio","container-title":"Synthese","DOI":"10.1007/s11229-019-02271-0","title":"Data science and molecular biology: prediction and mechanistic explanation","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11229-019-02271-0?utm_source=researcher_app&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=RESR_MRKT_Researcher_inbound"},

It teaches you a variety of approaches on how to design flexible systems, adjustable to any aesthetic or project in need of an identifiable visual language. -- To learn how to design flexible systems is not just learning another craft, it is going to change the way you think and work entirely. It is an approach, how to design. If you would place system design into a curriculum it would be the foundation course, putting you in the right mindset. You can apply the systemic approach to any discipline you will later specialize in, from corporate design, communication design, user experience design to textile design. -- The book is divided into three parts. The first part is a richly illustrated theoretic introduction (82 pages) explaining the past, present and future of flexible systems. It describes how they were used in the past, how they are used today and why they should not just organize formal solutions, but the way how we work. -- The second part is a hands-on, almost purely visual, description of how to design flexible systems on form, starting with a circle, triangle, square, pentagon and hexagon. Lots of instruction manuals and examples on how to use them on 148 pages! -- The third part explains how transformation processes can become flexible systems for visual identities. Especially creative coders, motion designers and people who love to experiment will have a lot of fun with this chapter. -- The mockups above don’t come close to the beautiful production we have in mind. We will print the 320 pages with three bright Pantone colors, impossible to imitate with CMYK or RGB, on a high bulk paper.

  {"id":"luan","abstract":"In <em>Technology and the Lifeworld</em> (<span><a href=\"#CR8\">1990</a></span>), Don Ihde advances what he calls \"formalisms\" for the ways in which we experience or relate to technology. In this article, I seek to clarify the grammar of Ihde's formalisms. Ihde's formalisms have not been the focus of scrutiny. Rather, they have largely been received in the literature as merely aphoristic or epigrammatical devices serving to clarify what can be explained in prose. My hypothesis is that Ihde's formalisms do not merely serve an epigrammatical function but rather admit of a generative grammar that extends his postphenomenological framework. I propose a notation that adheres to six rules of syntax that can be derived from Ihde's framework. I show that the proposed notation makes explicit the inter-relations among hidden dimensions of human–technology relations. Relying on my notation, I also suggest that the so-called cyborg turn is actually a turn away from the unharnessed syntax of Ihde's formalisms.","author":[{"family":"Luan","given":"Scott T."}],"citation-key":"luan","container-title":"Philosophy & Technology","DOI":"10.1007/s13347-019-00349-8","title":"The Hidden Dimensions of Human–Technology Relations","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13347-019-00349-8?utm_source=researcher_app&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=RESR_MRKT_Researcher_inbound"},

One unique aspect of the study was determining how laptop and longhand note taking influence the recording of lecture images in notes and image-related achievement. Note-taking results showed that laptop note takers recorded more notes (idea units and words) and more verbatim lecture strings than did longhand note takers who, in turn, recorded more visual notes (signals and images) than did laptop note takers. Achievement results showed that when taking laptop notes, the process function of note taking was more beneficial than the product function of note taking (i.e., better image-related learning and similar text-related learning). When taking longhand notes, the product function of note taking was more beneficial than the process function of note taking (i.e., better text-related learning and similar image-related learning).

  {"id":"lutz2023","abstract":"The stag-hunt game is a prototype for social contracts. Adopting a new and better social contract is usually challenging because the current one is already well established and stable due to sanctions imposed on non-conforming members. Thus, how does a population shift from the current social contract to a better one? In other words, how can a social system leave a locally optimum configuration to achieve a globally optimum state? Here, we investigate the effect of promoting diversity on the evolution of social contracts. We consider group-structured populations where individuals play the stag-hunt game in all groups. We model the diversity incentive as a snowdrift game played in a single focus group where the individual is more prone to adopting a deviant norm. We show that a moderate diversity incentive is sufficient to change the system dynamics, driving the population over the stag-hunt invasion barrier that prevents the global optimum being reached. Thus, an initial fraction of adopters of the new, better norm can drive the system toward the optimum social contract. If the diversity incentive is not too large, the better social contract is the new equilibrium and remains stable even if the incentive is turned off. However, if the incentive is large, the population is trapped in a mixed equilibrium and the better social norm can only be reached if the incentive is turned off after the equilibrium is reached. The results are obtained using Monte Carlo simulations and analytical approximation methods.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Lütz","given":"Alessandra F."},{"family":"Amaral","given":"Marco Antonio"},{"family":"Braga","given":"Ian"},{"family":"Wardil","given":"Lucas"}],"citation-key":"lutz2023","container-title":"Games","DOI":"10.3390/g14030042","ISSN":"2073-4336","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",6]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","number":"3","page":"42","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"Invasion of Optimal Social Contracts","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4336/14/3/42","volume":"14"},

This article proposes to accommodate such doubts by making a distinction between two kinds of unification and suggesting that while such doubts may be justified in regard to mere derivational unification (which serves as a formal constraint on theories), it is less justified in the case of ontological unification (which is a result of factual discovery of the actual degree of underlying unity in the world).","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",11,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Mäki","given":"Uskali"}],"citation-key":"maki2001","container-title":"Philosophy of the Social Sciences","container-title-short":"Philosophy of the Social Sciences","DOI":"10.1177/004839310103100402","ISSN":"0048-3931","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2001",12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"488-506","publisher":"SAGE Publications Inc","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Explanatory Unification: Double and Doubtful","title-short":"Explanatory Unification","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/004839310103100402","volume":"31"},

The first half of the paper is given over to introducing communication theory and its competing interpretations. The second half explores three consequences of the main thesis. First, a popular claim that the quantification of information in a signal is irrelevant for the meaning of that signal is exposed as fallacious. Second, a popular distinction between causal and semantic information is shown to be misleading, and I argue it should be replaced with a related distinction between natural and intentional signs.

  {"id":"manta2016","abstract":"The daily use by people of wireless communication devices has increased exponentially in the last decade, begetting concerns regarding its potential health hazards. Drosophila melanogaster four days-old adult female flies were exposed for 30 min to radiation emitted by a commercial mobile phone at a SAR of 0.15 W/kg and a SAE of 270 J/kg. ROS levels and apoptotic follicles were assayed in parallel with a genome-wide microarrays analysis. ROS cellular contents were found to increase by 1.6-fold (x), immediately after the end of exposure, in follicles of pre-choriogenic stages (germarium - stage 10), while sporadically generated apoptotic follicles (germarium 2b and stages 7–9) presented with an averaged 2x upregulation in their sub-population mass, 4 h after fly's irradiation with mobile device. Microarray analysis revealed 168 genes being differentially expressed, 2 h post-exposure, in response to radiofrequency (RF) electromagnetic field-radiation exposure (≥1.25x, P < 0.05) and associated with multiple and critical biological processes, such as basic metabolism and cellular subroutines related to stress response and apoptotic death. Exposure of adult flies to mobile-phone radiation for 30 min has an immediate impact on ROS production in animal's ovary, which seems to cause a global, systemic and non-targeted transcriptional reprogramming of gene expression, 2 h post-exposure, being finally followed by induction of apoptosis 4 h after the end of exposure. Conclusively, this unique type of pulsed radiation, mainly being derived from daily used mobile phones, seems capable of mobilizing critical cytopathic mechanisms, and altering fundamental genetic programs and networks in D. melanogaster.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Manta","given":"Areti K."},{"family":"Papadopoulou","given":"Deppie"},{"family":"Polyzos","given":"Alexander P."},{"family":"Fragopoulou","given":"Adamantia F."},{"family":"Skouroliakou","given":"Aikaterini S."},{"family":"Thanos","given":"Dimitris"},{"family":"Stravopodis","given":"Dimitrios J."},{"family":"Margaritis","given":"Lukas H."}],"citation-key":"manta2016","container-title":"Fly","container-title-short":"Fly (Austin)","DOI":"10.1080/19336934.2016.1270487","ISSN":"1933-6934","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",12,14]]},"page":"75-95","PMCID":"PMC5406167","PMID":"27960592","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Mobile-phone radiation-induced perturbation of gene-expression profiling, redox equilibrium and sporadic-apoptosis control in the ovary of Drosophila melanogaster","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5406167/","volume":"11"},

  {"id":"mazzarella2013","abstract":"According to Relevance Theory, pragmatic interpretation is guided by an expectation of (optimal) relevance. This expectation is constrained by considerations about the speaker’s mental states. In this paper I address a recent criticism against Relevance Theory put forth by Mazzone (2009, 2013). This criticism focuses on a core notion within the relevance-theoretic framework, that is, the notion of ‘optimal relevance’ and its role as a pragmatic criterion of acceptability. Mazzone suggests that the appeal to the notion of ‘optimal relevance’ is not enough to show how information about the speaker’s mental states (e.g., her knowledge and beliefs) affects on-line pragmatic processing. I develop a tentative line of solution to cognitively implement the notion of ‘optimal relevance’. My proposal is grounded on the interaction between the comprehension module and epistemic vigilance mechanisms, that is, those mechanisms which check the quality of incoming information and the reliability of the individual who dispenses it (Sperber et al., 2010).","author":[{"family":"Mazzarella","given":"Diana"}],"citation-key":"mazzarella2013","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013"]]},"language":"en","page":"26","source":"Zotero","title":"‘Optimal relevance’ as a pragmatic criterion: the role of epistemic vigilance","type":"article-journal"},

This paper reviews the core concepts of Searle's theory before concisely describing and then formally modelling their propositional structure.

Despite their distinct intellectual histories, I suggest there is a productive debate to be had by bringing assemblage and dwelling into dialogue.

  {"id":"mesterton-gibbons1992a","abstract":"This paper develops a mathematical model of an iterated, asymmetric Hawk-Dove game with the novel feature that not only are successive pairs of interactants — in the roles of owner and intruder contesting a site — drawn randomly from the population, but also the behaviour adopted at one interaction affects the role of a contestant in the next. Under the assumption that a site is essential for reproduction, the evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) of the population is found to depend on the probability, w, that the game will continue for at least a further period (which is inversely related to predation risk), and five other parameters; two of them are measures of site scarcity, two are measures of fighting costs, and the last is a measure of resource holding potential (RHP). Among the four strategies — Hawk (H), Dove (D), Bourgeois (B) and anti-Bourgeois (X) — only D is incapable of being an ESS; and regions of parameter space are found in which the ESS can be only H, or only X, or only B; or either H or X; or either X or B; or either H or B; or any of the three. The scarcer the sites or the lower the costs of fighting, or the lower the value of w, the more likely it is that H is an ESS; the more abundant the sites or the higher the costs of fighting, or the higher the value of w, the more likely it is that X or B is an ESS. The different ESSs are interpreted as different ecotypes. The analysis suggests how a non-fighting population could evolve from a fighting population under decreasing risk of predation. If there were no RHP, or if RHP were low, then the ESS in the non-fighting population would be X; only if RHP were sufficiently high would the ESS be B, and the scarcer the sites, the higher the RHP would have to be.

This study aimed to operationalize Hirsh-Pasek, Zosh, and colleagues' Four Pillars of Learning into a reliable coding scheme (Pillar 1: Active Learning, Pillar 2: Engagement in the Learning Process, Pillar 3: Meaningful Learning, Pillar 4: Social Interaction), describe the educational quality of commercially available apps, and examine differences in educational quality between free and paid apps. We analyzed 100 children’s educational apps with the highest downloads from Google Play and Apple app stores, as well as 24 apps most frequently played by preschool-age children in a longitudinal cohort study. We developed a coding scheme in which each app earned a value of 0–3 for each Pillar, defining lower-quality apps as those scoring ≤4, summed across the Four Pillars. Overall scores were low across all Pillars. Free apps had significantly lower Pillar 2 (Engagement in Learning Process) scores (t-test, p < .0001) and overall scores (t-test, p < .0047) when compared to paid apps, due to the presence of distracting enhancements. These results highlight the need for improved design of educational apps guided by developmental science.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Meyer","given":"Marisa"},{"family":"Zosh","given":"Jennifer M."},{"family":"McLaren","given":"Caroline"},{"family":"Robb","given":"Michael"},{"family":"McCaffery","given":"Harlan"},{"family":"Golinkoff","given":"Roberta Michnick"},{"family":"Hirsh-Pasek","given":"Kathy"},{"family":"Radesky","given":"Jenny"}],"citation-key":"meyer2021","container-title":"Journal of Children and Media","DOI":"10.1080/17482798.2021.1882516","ISSN":"1748-2798","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,2]]},"page":"526-548","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"How educational are “educational” apps for young children?

  {"id":"michael2015","abstract":"In this paper, we evaluate the proposal that a central function of commitments within joint action is to reduce various kinds of uncertainty, and that this accounts for the prevalence of commitments in joint action. While this idea is prima facie attractive, we argue that it faces two serious problems. First, commitments can only reduce uncertainty if they are credible, and accounting for the credibility of commitments proves not to be straightforward. Second, there are many other ways in which uncertainty is commonly reduced within joint actions, which raises the possibility that commitments may be superfluous. Nevertheless, we argue that the existence of these alternative uncertainty reduction processes does not make commitments superfluous after all but, rather, helps to explain how commitments may contribute in various ways to uncertainty reduction.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",5,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Michael","given":"John"},{"family":"Pacherie","given":"Elisabeth"}],"citation-key":"michael2015","container-title":"Journal of Social Ontology","DOI":"10.1515/jso-2014-0021","ISSN":"2196-9663","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"89-120","publisher":"De Gruyter","source":"www.degruyter.com","title":"On Commitments and Other Uncertainty Reduction Tools in Joint Action","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/jso-2014-0021/html","volume":"1"},

It does so by considering the boundaries of biological systems, from individual cells to  Home sapiens , in terms of the presence of Markov blankets under the active inference scheme—a corollary of the free energy principle. A Markov blanket defines the boundaries of a system in a statistical sense. Here we consider how a collective of Markov blankets can self-assemble into a global system that itself has a Markov blanket; thereby providing an illustration of how autonomous systems can be understood as having layers of nested and self-sustaining boundaries. This allows us to show that: (i) any living system is a Markov blanketed system and (ii) the boundaries of such systems need not be co-extensive with the biophysical boundaries of a living organism. In other words, autonomous systems are hierarchically composed of Markov blankets of Markov blankets—all the way down to individual cells, all the way up to you and me, and all the way out to include elements of the local environment.","author":[{"literal":"Michael D.

However, empirical studies using dual-process models often rely on ad hoc measures such as forced-choice surveys, observation, and interviews whose relationships to underlying cognitive processes are not fully established. In this article, we advance dual-process research in sociology by (1) proposing criteria for measuring automatic cognition, and (2) assessing the empirical performance of two popular measures of automatic cognition developed by psychologists. We compare the ability of the Brief Implicit Association Test (BIAT), the Affect Misattribution Procedure (AMP), and traditional forced-choice measures to predict process-pure estimates of automatic influences on individuals’ behavior during a survey task. Results from three studies focusing on politics, morality, and racial attitudes suggest the AMP provides the most valid and consistent measure of automatic cognitive processes.

While these wide accounts override traditional methodological individualism, the study of cognition has already progressed beyond these proposed perspectives towards building integrated explanations of the mechanisms involved, including not only internal submechanisms but also interactions with others, groups, cognitive artifacts, and their environment. The claim is substantiated with reference to recent developments in the study of “mindreading” and debates on emotions. We claim that the current practice in cognitive (neuro)science has undergone, in effect, a silent mechanistic revolution, and has turned from initial binary oppositions and abstract proposals towards the integration of wide perspectives with the rest of the cognitive (neuro)sciences.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",8,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Miłkowski","given":"Marcin"},{"family":"Clowes","given":"Robert"},{"family":"Rucińska","given":"Zuzanna"},{"family":"Przegalińska","given":"Aleksandra"},{"family":"Zawidzki","given":"Tadeusz"},{"family":"Krueger","given":"Joel"},{"family":"Gies","given":"Adam"},{"family":"McGann","given":"Marek"},{"family":"Afeltowicz","given":"Łukasz"},{"family":"Wachowski","given":"Witold"},{"family":"Stjernberg","given":"Fredrik"},{"family":"Loughlin","given":"Victor"},{"family":"Hohol","given":"Mateusz"}],"citation-key":"milkowski2018","container-title":"Frontiers in Psychology","container-title-short":"Front.

  {"id":"miller2024","abstract":"The term, “social institution” is somewhat unclear both inordinary language and in the philosophical literature (see below).However, contemporary sociology is somewhat more consistent in its useof the term. Typically, contemporary sociologists use the term torefer to complex social forms that reproduce themselves such asgovernments, the family, human languages, universities, hospitals,business corporations, and legal systems. A typical definition is thatproffered by Jonathan Turner (1997: 6): “a complex ofpositions, roles, norms and values lodged in particular types ofsocial structures and organising relatively stable patterns of humanactivity with respect to fundamental problems in producinglife-sustaining resources, in reproducing individuals, and insustaining viable societal structures within a givenenvironment.” Again, Anthony Giddens (1984: 24) says:“Institutions by definition are the more enduring features ofsocial life.” He (Giddens 1984: 31) goes on to list asinstitutional orders, modes of discourse, political institutions,economic institutions and legal institutions. The contemporaryphilosopher of social science, Rom Harre follows the theoreticalsociologists in offering this kind of definition (Harre 1979: 98):“An institution was defined as an interlocking double-structureof persons-as-role-holders or office-bearers and the like, and ofsocial practices involving both expressive and practical aims andoutcomes.” He gives as examples (Harre 1979: 97) schools, shops,post offices, police forces, asylums and the British monarchy. In thisentry the above-noted contemporary sociological usage will befollowed. Doing so has the virtue of grounding philosophical theory inthe most salient empirical discipline, namely, sociology.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",9,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Miller","given":"Seumas"}],"citation-key":"miller2024","container-title":"The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy","edition":"Fall 2024","editor":[{"family":"Zalta","given":"Edward N."},{"family":"Nodelman","given":"Uri"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2024"]]},"publisher":"Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University","source":"Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy","title":"Social Institutions","type":"chapter","URL":"https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2024/entries/social-institutions/"},

In Varieties of Meaning, Ruth Garrett Millikan argues that these different kinds of meaning can be understood only in relation to each other.What does meaning in the sense of purpose (when something is said to be meant for something) have to do with meaning in the sense of representing or signifying? Millikan argues that the explicit human purposes, explicit human intentions, are represented purposes. They do not merely represent purposes; they possess the purposes that they represent. She argues further that things that signify, intentional signs such as sentences, are distinguished from natural signs by having purpose essentially; therefore, unlike natural signs, intentional signs can misrepresent or be false.Part I discusses Purposes and Cross-Purposes -- what purposes are, the purposes of people, of their behaviors, of their body parts, of their artifacts, and of the signs they use. Part II then describes a previously unrecognized kind of natural sign, locally recurrent natural signs, and several varieties of intentional signs, and discusses the ways in which representations themselves are represented. Part III offers a novel interpretation of the way language is understood and of the relation between semantics and pragmatics. Part IV discusses perception and thought, exploring stages in the development of inner representations, from the simplest organisms whose behavior is governed by perception-action cycles to the perceptions and intentional attitudes of humans.","author":[{"family":"Millikan","given":"Ruth Garrett"},{"family":"Millikan","given":"Ruth G."}],"citation-key":"millikan2004","ISBN":"978-0-262-13444-6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2004"]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"262","publisher":"MIT Press","source":"Google Books","title":"Varieties of Meaning: The 2002 Jean Nicod Lectures","title-short":"Varieties of Meaning","type":"book"},

These proposals have been retrieved by putting together current descriptions from the literature on neural representations with earlier explorations of the features common to most things we are inclined to call representations (… maps, graphs, human language, signals between animals, stop signs … etc.) as these were assessed in Millikan (Language, thought and other biological categories.

We start from awareness, à la Lakatos, that a \"history of science without philosophy of science is blind, while a philosophy of science without the history of science is empty\". However, during the twentieth century Italian different theoretical positions emerged. Giulio Preti began by underlining how the history of science should be understood as the history of scientific thought. This position was close to that expressed by Giovanni Gentile for whom the history of science had to be reduced to the history of philosophy. Against this neo-realist claim, an epistemologist like Ludovico Geymonat reacted by underlining how science has its own history as a science. The critical debate between Preti and Geymonat has finally led the first to underline how the history of science must then be articulated in different conceptual traditions, while the latter ended up sharing the need to study the history of science as a history of scientific thought.","author":[{"family":"Minazzi","given":"Fabio"}],"citation-key":"minazzi","container-title":"Axiomathes","DOI":"10.1007/s10516-019-09437-y","title":"Epistemology and the History of Science: The Problem of Historical Epistemology in the Italian Debate of the Twentieth Century","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10516-019-09437-y?utm_source=researcher_app&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=RESR_MRKT_Researcher_inbound"},

Gossip is more likely when norm violations are severe and when punishers have less power, value offenders less, and experience disgust.

Furthermore, I show how that the successful application of mathematics in science is an important trigger for the objectivity of mathematical knowledge.","author":[{"family":"Molinini","given":"Daniele"}],"citation-key":"molinini","container-title":"Axiomathes","DOI":"10.1007/s10516-019-09449-8","title":"The Weak Objectivity of Mathematics and Its Reasonable Effectiveness in Science","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10516-019-09449-8?utm_source=researcher_app&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=RESR_MRKT_Researcher_inbound"},

  {"id":"moon2014","abstract":"Abstract\n            Natural scientists are increasingly interested in social research because they recognize that conservation problems are commonly social problems. Interpreting social research, however, requires at least a basic understanding of the philosophical principles and theoretical assumptions of the discipline, which are embedded in the design of social research. Natural scientists who engage in social science but are unfamiliar with these principles and assumptions can misinterpret their results. We developed a guide to assist natural scientists in understanding the philosophical basis of social science to support the meaningful interpretation of social research outcomes. The 3 fundamental elements of research are ontology, what exists in the human world that researchers can acquire knowledge about; epistemology, how knowledge is created; and philosophical perspective, the philosophical orientation of the researcher that guides her or his action. Many elements of the guide also apply to the natural sciences. Natural scientists can use the guide to assist them in interpreting social science research to determine how the ontological position of the researcher can influence the nature of the research; how the epistemological position can be used to support the legitimacy of different types of knowledge; and how philosophical perspective can shape the researcher's choice of methods and affect interpretation, communication, and application of results. The use of this guide can also support and promote the effective integration of the natural and social sciences to generate more insightful and relevant conservation research outcomes.\n            Una Guía para Entender la Investigación de Ciencias Sociales para las Ciencias Naturales Katie Moon\n          , \n            Resumen\n            Los científicos de la Naturaleza cada vez están más interesados en la investigación social porque reconocen que los problemas de la conservación comúnmente son problemas sociales.

  {"id":"moreira2021","abstract":"Evidence suggests that engineered nanomaterials (ENM) can induce epigenetic modifications. In this review, we provide an overview of the epigenetic modulation of gene expression induced by ENM used in a variety of applications: titanium dioxide (TiO2), silver (Ag), gold (Au), silica (SiO2) nanoparticles and carbon-based nanomaterials (CNM). Exposure to these ENM can trigger alterations in cell patterns of DNA methylation, post-transcriptional histone modifications and expression of non-coding RNA. Such effects are dependent on ENM dose and physicochemical properties including size, shape and surface chemistry, as well as on the cell/organism sensitivity. The genes affected are mostly involved in the regulation of the epigenetic machinery itself, as well as in apoptosis, cell cycle, DNA repair and inflammation related pathways, whose long-term alterations might lead to the onset or progression of certain pathologies. In addition, some DNA methylation patterns may be retained as a form of epigenetic memory. Prenatal exposure to ENM may impair the normal development of the offspring by transplacental effects and/or putative transmission of epimutations in imprinting genes. Thus, understanding the impact of ENM on the epigenome is of paramount importance and epigenetic evaluation must be considered when assessing the risk of ENM to human health.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Moreira","given":"Luciana"},{"family":"Costa","given":"Carla"},{"family":"Pires","given":"Joana"},{"family":"Teixeira","given":"João Paulo"},{"family":"Fraga","given":"Sónia"}],"citation-key":"moreira2021","container-title":"Mutation Research/Reviews in Mutation Research","container-title-short":"Mutation Research/Reviews in Mutation Research","DOI":"10.1016/j.mrrev.2021.108385","ISSN":"1383-5742","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",7,1]]},"page":"108385","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"How can exposure to engineered nanomaterials influence our epigenetic code?

  {"id":"morsky2019","abstract":"Social norms regulate and coordinate most aspects of human social life, yet they emerge and change as a result of individual behaviors, beliefs, and expectations. A satisfactory account for the evolutionary dynamics of social norms, therefore, has to link individual beliefs and expectations to population-level dynamics, where individual norms change according to their consequences for individuals. Here, we present a model of evolutionary dynamics of social norms that encompasses this objective and addresses the emergence of social norms. In this model, a norm is a set of behavioral prescriptions and a set of environmental descriptions that describe the expected behaviors of those with whom the norm holder will interact. These prescriptions and descriptions are functions of exogenous environmental events. These events have no intrinsic meaning or effect on the payoffs to individuals, yet beliefs/superstitions regarding them can effectuate coordination. Although a norm’s prescriptions and descriptions are dependent on one another, we show how they emerge from random accumulations of beliefs. We categorize the space of social norms into several natural classes and study the evolutionary competition between these classes of norms. We apply our model to the Game of Chicken and the Nash Bargaining Game. Furthermore, we show how the space of norms and evolutionary stability are dependent on the correlation structure of the environment and under which such correlation structures social dilemmas can be ameliorated or exacerbated.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",7,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Morsky","given":"Bryce"},{"family":"Akçay","given":"Erol"}],"citation-key":"morsky2019","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"Proc Natl Acad Sci USA","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1817095116","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","issue":"18","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",4,30]]},"language":"en","page":"8834-8839","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Evolution of social norms and correlated equilibria","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.pnas.org/lookup/doi/10.1073/pnas.1817095116","volume":"116"},

  {"id":"mosconi2022","abstract":"In this paper, we introduce an innovative design concept for the curation of data, which we call 'Data Story'. We view this as an additional resource for data curation, aimed specifically at supporting the sharing of qualitative and ethnographic data. The Data Story concept is motivated by three elements: 1. the increased attention of funding agencies and academic institutions on Research Data Management and Open Science; 2. our own work with colleagues applying ethnographic research methods; and 3. existing literature that has identified specific challenges in this context. Ongoing issues entailed in dealing with certain contextual factors that are inherent to qualitative research reveal the extent to which we still lack technical design solutions that can support meaningful curation and sharing. Data Story provides a singular way of addressing these issues by integrating traditional data curation approaches, where research data are treated as 'objects' to be curated and preserved according to specific standards, with a more contextual, culturally-nuanced and collaborative organizing layer that can be thought of as a \"Story\". The concept draws on existing literature on data curation, digital storytelling and Critical Data Studies (CDS). As a possible design solution for Research Data Management and data curation, Data Story offers: 1) a collaborative workflow for data curation; 2) a story-like format that can serve as an organizing principle; 3) a means of enhancing and naturalizing curation practices through storytelling.

Moreover, a computational analysis of the CS game shows that such perfect ambiguous systems have the same emergence probability as non-ambiguous perfect signaling systems in multi-agent simulations under standard evolutionary dynamics. We contrast these results with an experimental study where pairs of participants play the CS game for multiple rounds with each other in the lab to develop a communication system.

  {"id":"mussavifard2023","abstract":"The standard cognitive explanation for the emergence of human communication is that it rests largely on the expression and attribution of communicative intentions which are, in turn, enabled by complex metarepresentations of mental states. This complexity is at odds with the limited metapsychological abilities of infants. But mentalistic metarepresentations are neither necessary nor sufficient in explaining communication. Coded ostensive signals (e.g., eye contact) and established channels (e.g., speech) allow that communicative episodes be identified through decoding rather than metarepresentational inferences. Thus, some metarepresentations may be unnecessary. However, metapsychology is also insufficient for explaining communication: the logic of instrumental actions permits interpreting their effect as following from intentions, yet the effect of communicative actions is often unavailable for inferring meaning. Moreover, current evidence for the developmental trajectory of communication and mental state attribution does not support the emergence of the former from the latter. My proposal is that our primitive concept of communication targets, instead, representational action. When we communicate, we typically convey a propositional content that is detached from our acts—a property absent in ordinary goal-directed actions. This view additionally raises the possibility that metarepresentational capacities evolved for representing external, communicative representations and were only later exapted for other purposes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Mussavifard","given":"Nima"}],"citation-key":"mussavifard2023","container-title":"Synthese","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"language":"en","source":"www.semanticscholar.org","title":"Metarepresenting in communication","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Metarepresenting-in-communication-Mussavifard/8d07c2e3b4e468925c9bd70eeab05c8130180696"},

Because human behavior takes place in a complex social world, it imposes high demand on cognitive capacity. Yet the cognitive resources available to humans to meet this demand are relatively limited. Selectivity is a crucial element in social cognition. Only through informational selection are humans able to make decisions that are simultaneously adaptive and ef�cient. This chapter reviews evidence from social cognition research which demonstrates that humans are selective in the social information they attend to, the manner in which they process this information, and the behaviors they ultimately enact. This selectivity in social attention, social thinking, and social behavior is an adaptive tool that helps humans successfully maneuver through their complex social worlds.","author":[{"family":"Mussweiler","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Todd","given":"Andrew R"},{"family":"Crusius","given":"Jan"}],"citation-key":"mussweiler2012","container-title":"Evolution and the mechanisms of decision making","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012"]]},"language":"en","page":"12","publisher":"MIT Press","source":"Zotero","title":"The Cognitive Underpinnings of Social Behavior","type":"chapter"},

Next, I motivate Non-Inferentialism by showing that under the assumption of the widely-accepted Principle of Cognitive Economy, any account that treats mental state perception as an inferential process commits itself to an unrealistically inefficient picture of our cognitive architecture. Drawing on research in cognitive science, I will then show that my Non-Inferentialist view receives direct support by the available empirical evidence.

Previous studies suggest that simple learning algorithms based on local interactions, such as reinforcement learning, sufficiently give rise to signaling systems in decentralized populations. However, those algorithms often fail to achieve optimal signaling systems. Under what condition do suboptimal signaling systems emerge? To address this question, we propose a multi-agent model of signaling games with three parameters – memory length, the complexity of communication problems, and population size – as potential constraints imposed on the collective learning process. The results from numerical experiments suggest that finite memory leads to suboptimal signaling systems, characterized by redundant signal-meaning associations. This paper concludes with discussions on the theoretical implications of the findings and the directions of future research.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Oh","given":"Poong"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Soojong"}],"citation-key":"oh2021","container-title":"Communication Methods and Measures","DOI":"10.1080/19312458.2020.1768519","ISSN":"1931-2458","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,2]]},"page":"255-272","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"An Evolutionary Model of the Emergence of Meanings","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/19312458.2020.1768519","volume":"15"},

  {"id":"okasha2012","abstract":"This volume explores from multiple perspectives the subtle and interesting relationship between the theory of rational choice and Darwinian evolution. In rational choice theory, agents are assumed to make choices that maximize their utility; in evolution, natural selection 'chooses' between phenotypes according to the criterion of fitness maximization. So there is a parallel between utility in rational choice theory and fitness in Darwinian theory. This conceptual link between fitness and utility is mirrored by the interesting parallels between formal models of evolution and rational choice. The essays in this volume, by leading philosophers, economists, biologists and psychologists, explore the connection between evolution and rational choice in a number of different contexts, including choice under uncertainty, strategic decision making and pro-social behaviour. They will be of interest to students and researchers in philosophy of science, evolutionary biology, economics and psychology.","author":[{"family":"Okasha","given":"Samir"},{"family":"Binmore","given":"Ken"}],"citation-key":"okasha2012","ISBN":"978-1-107-00499-3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",6,21]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"293","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"Google Books","title":"Evolution and Rationality: Decisions, Co-operation and Strategic Behaviour","title-short":"Evolution and Rationality","type":"book"},

We show how the principle of inclusive ﬁtness maximization and a related principle of quasi-inclusive ﬁtness maximization can be derived from axioms on an individual’s ‘as if preferences’ (binary choices) for the case in which phenotypic eﬀects are additive.

In this paper, we argue that the distinctive features of human culture derive from humans' unique skills and motivations for coordinating with one another around different types of action and information. As different levels of these skills of ‘shared intentionality’ emerged over the last several hundred thousand years, human culture became characterized first by such things as collaborative activities and pedagogy based on cooperative communication, and then by such things as collaborative innovations and normatively structured pedagogy. As a kind of capstone of this trajectory, humans began to coordinate not just on joint actions and shared beliefs, but on the reasons for what we believe or how we act. Coordinating on reasons powered the kinds of extremely rapid innovation and stable cumulative cultural evolution especially characteristic of the human species in the last several tens of thousands of years.\n\nThis article is part of a discussion meeting issue ‘The emergence of collective knowledge and cumulative culture in animals, humans and machines’.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,7]]},"author":[{"family":"O'Madagain","given":"Cathal"},{"family":"Tomasello","given":"Michael"}],"citation-key":"omadagain2021","container-title":"Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","DOI":"10.1098/rstb.2020.0320","issue":"1843","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,13]]},"page":"20200320","publisher":"Royal Society","source":"royalsocietypublishing.org (Atypon)","title":"Shared intentionality, reason-giving and the evolution of human culture","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2020.0320","volume":"377"},
  {"id":"oseaskvik2020","abstract":"<p>To write by hand, to type, or to draw – which of these strategies is the most efficient for optimal learning in the classroom? As digital devices are increasingly replacing traditional writing by hand, it is crucial to examine the long-term implications of this practice. High-density electroencephalogram (HD EEG) was used in 12 young adults and 12, 12-year-old children to study brain electrical activity as they were writing in cursive by hand, typewriting, or drawing visually presented words that were varying in difficulty. Analyses of temporal spectral evolution (TSE, i.e., time-dependent amplitude changes) were performed on EEG data recorded with a 256-channel sensor array. For young adults, we found that when writing by hand using a digital pen on a touchscreen, brain areas in the parietal and central regions showed event-related synchronized activity in the theta range. Existing literature suggests that such oscillatory neuronal activity in these particular brain areas is important for memory and for the encoding of new information and, therefore, provides the brain with optimal conditions for learning. When drawing, we found similar activation patterns in the parietal areas, in addition to event-related desynchronization in the alpha/beta range, suggesting both similarities but also slight differences in activation patterns when drawing and writing by hand. When typewriting on a keyboard, we found event-related desynchronized activity in the theta range and, to a lesser extent, in the alpha range in parietal and central brain regions. However, as this activity was desynchronized and differed from when writing by hand and drawing, its relation to learning remains unclear. For 12-year-old children, the same activation patterns were found, but to a lesser extent. We suggest that children, from an early age, must be exposed to handwriting and drawing activities in school to establish the neuronal oscillation patterns that are beneficial for learning. We conclude that because of the benefits of sensory-motor integration due to the larger involvement of the senses as well as fine and precisely controlled hand movements when writing by hand and when drawing, it is vital to maintain both activities in a learning environment to facilitate and optimize learning.</p>","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Ose Askvik","given":"Eva"},{"family":"Weel","given":"F.

  {"id":"oullier2008","abstract":"Spontaneous social coordination has been extensively described in natural settings but so far no controlled methodological approaches have been employed that systematically advance investigations into the possible self-organized nature of bond formation and dissolution between humans. We hypothesized that, under certain contexts, spontaneous synchrony-a well-described phenomenon in biological and physical settings-could emerge spontaneously between humans as a result of information exchange. Here, a new way to quantify interpersonal interactions in real time is proposed. In a simple experimental paradigm, pairs of participants facing each other were required to actively produce actions, while provided (or not) with the vision of similar actions being performed by someone else. New indices of interpersonal coordination, inspired by the theoretical framework of coordination dynamics (based on relative phase and frequency overlap between movements of individuals forming a pair) were developed and used. Results revealed that spontaneous phase synchrony (i.e., unintentional in-phase coordinated behavior) between two people emerges as soon as they exchange visual information, even if they are not explicitly instructed to coordinate with each other. Using the same tools, we also quantified the degree to which the behavior of each individual remained influenced by the social encounter even after information exchange had been removed, apparently a kind of social memory.","archive":"Scopus","author":[{"family":"Oullier","given":"O."},{"family":"Guzman","given":"G.","non-dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Jantzen","given":"K.J."},{"family":"Lagarde","given":"J."},{"family":"Scott Kelso","given":"J.A."}],"citation-key":"oullier2008","container-title":"Social Neuroscience","DOI":"10.1080/17470910701563392","ISSN":"1747-0927","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008"]]},"page":"178-192","source":"Scopus","title":"Social coordination dynamics: Measuring human bonding","title-short":"Social coordination dynamics","type":"article-journal","volume":"3"},
  {"id":"pacheco2015","abstract":"Collective signaling for a quorum is found in a wide range of organisms that face collective action problems whose successful solution requires the participation of some quorum of the individuals present. These range from humans, to social insects, to bacteria. The mechanisms involved, the quorum required, and the size of the group may vary. Here we address the general question of the evolution of collective signaling at a high level of abstraction. We investigate the evolutionary dynamics of a population engaging in a signaling N-person game theoretic model. Parameter settings allow for loners and cheaters, and for costly or costless signals. We find a rich dynamics, showing how natural selection, operating on a population of individuals endowed with the simplest strategies, is able to evolve a costly signaling system that allows individuals to respond appropriately to different states of Nature. Signaling robustly promotes cooperative collective action, in particular when coordinated action is most needed and difficult to achieve. Two different signaling systems may emerge depending on Nature’s most prevalent states.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Pacheco","given":"Jorge M."},{"family":"Vasconcelos","given":"Vítor V."},{"family":"Santos","given":"Francisco C."},{"family":"Skyrms","given":"Brian"}],"citation-key":"pacheco2015","container-title":"PLOS Computational Biology","container-title-short":"PLOS Computational Biology","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004101","ISSN":"1553-7358","issue":"2","issued":{"literal":"23 февр. 2015 г."},"language":"en","page":"e1004101","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Co-evolutionary Dynamics of Collective Action with Signaling for a Quorum","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004101","volume":"11"},

Notions like \"denumerability,\" \"modal scope distinction,\" \"Bayesian conditionalization,\" and \"logical completeness\" are usually only elucidated deep within difficult specialist texts. By offering simple explanations that by-pass much irrelevant and boring detail, Philosophical Devices is able to cover a wealth of material that is normally only available to specialists. The book contains four sections, each of three chapters. The first section is about sets and numbers, starting with the membership relation and ending with the generalized continuum hypothesis. The second is about analyticity, a prioricity, and necessity. The third is about probability, outlining the difference between objective and subjective probability and exploring aspects of conditionalization and correlation. The fourth deals with metalogic, focusing on the contrast between syntax and semantics, and finishing with a sketch of Godel's theorem. Philosophical Devices will be useful for university students who have got past the foothills of philosophy and are starting to read more widely, but it does not assume any prior expertise. All the issues discussed are intrinsically interesting, and often downright fascinating.

  {"id":"parkinson2021","abstract":"From its beginning, the study of networks has drawn on a variety of disciplinary perspectives. For much of its history, research on social networks has assumed that social networks behave like other similarly large, interconnected structures. However, the nodes that make up social networks—human beings—think and behave in flexible, complex, and often seemingly irrational ways. A deep understanding of social networks, therefore, requires not only analysis at the network level but also an understanding of how such networks shape and are shaped by the psychological processes of their members. In recent years, psychology has begun to make inroads into the network literature, but while neuroscience is an increasingly important area of psychology, research on the neuroscience of social networks remains scarce. This chapter reviews extant research pertaining to the neuroscience of social networks and sketches a research agenda to augment this already interdisciplinary field with insights from neuroscience.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Parkinson","given":"Carolyn"},{"family":"Wheatley","given":"Thalia"},{"family":"Kleinbaum","given":"Adam M."}],"citation-key":"parkinson2021","container-author":[{"family":"Parkinson","given":"Carolyn"},{"family":"Wheatley","given":"Thalia"},{"family":"Kleinbaum","given":"Adam M."}],"container-title":"The Oxford Handbook of Social Networks","DOI":"10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190251765.013.30","editor":[{"family":"Light","given":"Ryan"},{"family":"Moody","given":"James"}],"ISBN":"978-0-19-025176-5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",1,14]]},"language":"en","page":"495-515","publisher":"Oxford University Press","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The Neuroscience of Social Networks","type":"chapter","URL":"https://oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190251765.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780190251765-e-30"},

  {"id":"paternotte2014","abstract":"There exist many competing philosophical definitions of joint action and no clear criteria to decide between them; so far the search for definitions has by and large been a semantical enterprise rather than an empirical one. This chapter describes and assesses several constraints that could help converge towards a set of necessary and sufficient conditions for joint action. The tightness constraint favours definitions that fit joint actions in which the links between agents are as relaxed as possible, so as to better pinpoint the conceptual core of jointness. The developmental constraint asks for definitions based on realistic psychological states that could be entertained by agents less cognitively developed than ideal human beings. The motor constraint holds that definitions should refer to psychological mechanisms involved in actual human coordination. These first three constraints are discussed and dismissed, mainly because they manage to establish vague limits at best (for various reasons). I then introduce a fourth one, the efficiency constraint, based on the fact that most of our joint actions are generally successful, and according to which definitions should involve conditions that help justify this success. Finally, the rational and evolutionary versions of the efficiency constraint are examined and defended against objections.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",2,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Paternotte","given":"Cédric"}],"citation-key":"paternotte2014","collection-title":"Studies in the Philosophy of Sociality","container-title":"Perspectives on Social Ontology and Social Cognition","DOI":"10.1007/978-94-017-9147-2_8","editor":[{"family":"Gallotti","given":"Mattia"},{"family":"Michael","given":"John"}],"event-place":"Dordrecht","ISBN":"978-94-017-9147-2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]},"language":"en","page":"103-123","publisher":"Springer Netherlands","publisher-place":"Dordrecht","source":"Springer Link","title":"Constraints on Joint Action","type":"chapter","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-94-017-9147-2_8"},

Yi provides logical analyses of the predicates 'one' and 'many' which seem to show that nothing can satisfy them both. But there are (at least) two senses of the word 'one'. One of these senses is not captured by Yi's analysis, and in this sense of the word, it is logically possible for many things to be one.

We trace a portion of the history of this concept, beginning with the theologically and economically grounded work of Linnaeus, moving through Darwin’s adaptation of the economy of nature and its reconstitution in genetic terms during the first decades of the Modern Synthesis. What this historical case study reveals, we argue, is a window into the shifting landscape of the explanatory and ontic uses of structural concepts. In Linnaeus, the economy of nature has both ontic and explanatory import; in Darwin the ontic and explanatory aspects start to come apart (with the explanatory aspect being foregrounded); and finally, in the Modern Synthesis, the economy of nature is replaced by the conceptual toolkit of population genetics, the structural elements of which are nearly entirely explanatory. Having traced a historical trajectory of structural concepts that moves from an ontic formulation to an increasingly explanatory one, we conclude by outlining some insights for structural realism.</p>","author":[{"family":"Pence","given":"Charles H."},{"family":"Swaim","given":"Daniel G."}],"citation-key":"pence","container-title":"European Journal for Philosophy of Science","DOI":"10.1007/s13194-017-0194-0","title":"The economy of nature: the structure of evolution in Linnaeus, Darwin, and the modern synthesis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13194-017-0194-0?utm_source=researcher_app&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=RESR_MRKT_Researcher_inbound"},

As a consequence, some scholars have started soliciting attempts to systematize this emerging field of research. Based on these premises, the study aims to: explore how the frugal innovation concept has developed over the years; analyze the main key findings from the extant literature on frugal innovation to lay a foundation for subsequent works, by identifying gaps in current knowledge; highlight new directions for future research. In doing so, we carried out a systematic literature review (SLR) and analyzed 113 articles that have been published since 1990.

  {"id":"planer2023","abstract":"It has seemed to many theorists that our nature as a cooperatively breeding species is crucial to understanding how we became fully human. This article examines a particular strand within this thinking, according to which cooperative breeding drove the evolution of human skills and motivations for sharing intentionality. More specifically, I consider a model of the evolution of these skills and motivations offered by Tomasello and González-Cabrera (2017). Their model is “composite” in that it also recognizes an important role for collaborative foraging in the evolution of shared intentionality. I argue that their model (or more precisely: a natural construal of it) faces at least two problems—what I call the “reflexive metacognition problem” and the “bonding problem.” These two problems (as their names would suggest) concern the cognitive and emotional-motivational dimensions of the evolution of shared intentionality, respectively. I sketch an alternative evolutionary scenario which also posits a dual role for collaborative foraging and cooperative breeding. However, there are some crucial differences between the two models. In particular, the Tomasello and González-Cabrera model appeals to cooperative breeding in explaining the initial appearance of basic skills and motivations for sharing intentionality. In contrast, I argue that cooperative breeding, at least initially, instead served to drive down the age of development of preexisting skills and motivations for sharing intentionality that originally evolved to support collaborative foraging in adult life. This alternative model avoids the reflexive cognition and bonding problem, and has other advantages which I highlight.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Planer","given":"Ronald J."}],"citation-key":"planer2023","container-title":"Philosophy, Theory, and Practice in Biology","DOI":"10.3998/ptpbio.4338","ISSN":"2475-3025","issue":"0","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",5,22]]},"license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","source":"Semantic Scholar","title":"Cooperative Breeding and the Evolutionary Origins of Shared Intentionality","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.publishing.umich.edu/ptpbio/article/id/4338/","volume":"15"},

  {"id":"porter","abstract":"Teleosemantics explains mental representation in terms of etiological history: a mental state's representational contents are the result of natural selection, or some other selection process. Critics have argued that the \"swampman\" thought experiment poses a counterexample to teleosemantics. In several recent papers, Papineau has argued that a merely possible swampman cannot serve as a counterexample to teleosemantics, but has acknowledged that actual swampmen would pose a problem for teleosemantics. In this paper, I argue that there are real-world cases of swampman-like representation, in the form of functional tetrachromacy. People with functional tetrachromacy are born with four types of cones in each eye, rather than the usual three, and as a result can represent a wider variety of colors than the average person. I argue that the functional tetrachromat's additional color representations are not the result of a selection process. Functional tetrachromacy is therefore a real-world case of mental representation without an etiological history, and therefore poses a genuine counterexample to teleosemantics.","author":[{"family":"Porter","given":"Brian"}],"citation-key":"porter","container-title":"Biology and Philosophy","DOI":"10.1007/s10539-019-9732-9","title":"Teleosemantics and tetrachromacy","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10539-019-9732-9?utm_source=researcher_app&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=RESR_MRKT_Researcher_inbound"},
  {"id":"powers2013","abstract":"Human cooperation is typically coordinated by institutions, which determine the outcome structure of the social interactions individuals engage in. Explaining the Neolithic transition from small- to large-scale societies involves understanding how these institutions co-evolve with demography. We study this using a demographically explicit model of institution formation in a patch-structured population. Each patch supports both social and asocial niches. Social individuals create an institution, at a cost to themselves, by negotiating how much of the costly public good provided by cooperators is invested into sanctioning defectors. The remainder of their public good is invested in technology that increases carrying capacity, such as irrigation systems. We show that social individuals can invade a population of asocials, and form institutions that support high levels of cooperation. We then demonstrate conditions where the co-evolution of cooperation, institutions, and demographic carrying capacity creates a transition from small- to large-scale social groups.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",7,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Powers","given":"Simon T."},{"family":"Lehmann","given":"Laurent"}],"citation-key":"powers2013","container-title":"Ecology Letters","DOI":"10.1111/ele.12178","ISSN":"1461-0248","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013"]]},"language":"en","page":"1356-1364","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"The co-evolution of social institutions, demography, and large-scale human cooperation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ele.12178","volume":"16"},

First, how do social interactions in small-scale and large-scale societies differ? By reviewing the exchange and collective-action dilemmas in both small-scale and large-scale societies, we show they are not different. Second, are individual decision-making mechanisms driven by self-interest? We extract from the literature three types of individual decision-making mechanism, which differ in their social influence and sensitivity to self-interest, to conclude that humans interacting with non-relatives are largely driven by self-interest. We then ask: what was the key mechanism that allowed prosocial behaviors to continue as societies grew? We show the key role played by new social interaction mechanisms—change in the rules of exchange and collective-action dilemmas—devised by the interacting individuals, which allow for self-interested individuals to remain prosocial as societies grow.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",7,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Powers","given":"Simon T."},{"family":"Schaik","given":"Carel P.","non-dropping-particle":"van"},{"family":"Lehmann","given":"Laurent"}],"citation-key":"powers2021","container-title":"Evolutionary Anthropology: Issues, News, and Reviews","DOI":"10.1002/evan.21909","ISSN":"1520-6505","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"language":"en","page":"280-293","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Cooperation in large-scale human societies—What, if anything, makes it unique, and how did it evolve?","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/evan.21909","volume":"30"},

The integrative framework we propose bridges cognitive and social sciences to provide (i) an expanded concept of ‘affordance’ that extends to sociocultural forms of life, and (ii) a multilevel account of the socioculturally scaffolded forms of affordance learning and the transmission of affordances in patterned sociocultural practices and regimes of shared attention.

Models are trained on a set of common psychophysical tasks, and receive instructions embedded by a pretrained language model. Our best models can perform a previously unseen task with an average performance of 83% correct based solely on linguistic instructions (that is, zero-shot learning). We found that language scaffolds sensorimotor representations such that activity for interrelated tasks shares a common geometry with the semantic representations of instructions, allowing language to cue the proper composition of practiced skills in unseen settings. We show how this model generates a linguistic description of a novel task it has identified using only motor feedback, which can subsequently guide a partner model to perform the task.

Here, I develop the theory that reputation building may signal cooperative intent, or trustworthiness. I model a simple representation of this theory in which individuals (1) optionally invest in a reputation by performing costly helpful behaviour (signalling); (2) optionally use others reputations when choosing a partner; and (3) optionally cooperate with that partner. In evolutionary simulations, high levels of reputation building; of choosing partners based on reputation; and of cooperation within partnerships emerged. Costly helping behaviour evolved into an honest signal of trustworthiness when it was adaptive for cooperators, relative to defectors, to invest in the long-term benefits of a reputation for helping. I show using game theory that this occurs when cooperators gain larger marginal benefits from investing in signalling than do defectors. This happens without the usual costly signalling assumption that individuals are of two types which differ in quality. Signalling of trustworthiness may help explain phenomena such as philanthropy, pro-sociality, collective action, punishment, and advertising in humans and may be particularly applicable to courtship in other animals.","author":[{"family":"Roberts","given":"Roberts"},{"family":"G.","given":"G."}],"citation-key":"roberts","container-title":"bioRxiv Animal Behavior and Cognition","DOI":"10.1101/2019.12.11.873208","title":"Honest signalling of trustworthiness","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2019.12.11.873208v1?rss=1&utm_source=researcher_app&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=RESR_MRKT_Researcher_inbound"},

Yet very little is known about variations in the patterns of past social interactions between humans in cultural evolution. The archaeological record, combined with modern evolutionary and analytical approaches, provides a unique opportunity to investigate broad-scale patterns of cultural change. Prompted by evidence that a population's social connectivity influences cultural variability, in this article, we revisit traditional approaches used to infer cultural evolutionary processes from the archaeological data. We then propose that frameworks considering multi-scalar interactions (from individuals to populations) over time and space have the potential to advance knowledge in cultural evolutionary theory. We describe how social network analysis can be applied to analyse diachronic structural changes and test cultural transmission hypotheses using the archaeological record (here specifically from the Marine Isotope Stage 3 ca 57–29 ka onwards). We argue that the reconstruction of prehistoric networks offers a timely opportunity to test the interplay between social connectivity and culture and ultimately helps to disentangle evolutionary mechanisms in the archaeological record.\n\nThis article is part of a discussion meeting issue ‘The emergence of collective knowledge and cumulative culture in animals, humans and machines’.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Romano","given":"Valéria"},{"family":"Lozano","given":"Sergi"},{"family":"Fernández-López de Pablo","given":"Javier"}],"citation-key":"romano2021","container-title":"Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","DOI":"10.1098/rstb.2020.0318","issue":"1843","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,13]]},"page":"20200318","publisher":"Royal Society","source":"royalsocietypublishing.org (Atypon)","title":"Reconstructing social networks of Late Glacial and Holocene hunter–gatherers to understand cultural evolution","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2020.0318","volume":"377"},

More in particular, we discuss the possibility that many generic sentences of the form '<em class=\"EmphasisTypeItalic\">k</em>s have feature <em class=\"EmphasisTypeItalic\">e</em>' are true because (members of) kind <em class=\"EmphasisTypeItalic\">k</em> have the causal power to 'produce' feature <em class=\"EmphasisTypeItalic\">e</em>. We will argue that such an analysis is quite close to a probabilistic based analysis of generic sentences according to which 'relatively many' <em class=\"EmphasisTypeItalic\">k</em>s have feature <em class=\"EmphasisTypeItalic\">e</em>, and that, in fact, this latter type of analysis can be 'grounded' in terms of causal powers. We will argue, moreover, that the causal power analysis is sometimes preferred to a correlation-based analysis, because it takes the causal structure that gives rise to the probabilistic data into account.","author":[{"family":"Rooij","given":"Robert","dropping-particle":"van"}],"citation-key":"rooij","container-title":"Topoi","DOI":"10.1007/s11245-019-09663-4","title":"A Causal Power Semantics for Generic Sentences","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11245-019-09663-4?utm_source=researcher_app&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=RESR_MRKT_Researcher_inbound"},

In consequence, it is also generally recognized that game theory is an important tool for studying these phenomena. However, the best known game theoretic applications to date tend to assimilate linguistic communication with signaling. The individualistic philosophical bias in Western social ontology makes signaling seem more challenging than it really is, and thus focuses attention on theoretical problems – for example, coordination on lexical meaning – that actual evolution did not need to solve by improving humans’ strategic or social intelligence relative to the endowments of other primates. At the same time, issues of genuine evolutionary significance related to language, especially those around the tensions between individual and collective agency, and around intergenerational accumulation of knowledge, are obscured. This in turn leads to underestimation of the potential contribution that game theory can make to enlightening models of the evolution of human language.

  {"id":"ross2023","abstract":"Abstract Recently, philosophers have developed an extensive literature on social ontology that applies methods and concepts from analytic metaphysics. Much of this is entirely abstracted from, and unconcerned with, social science. However, Epstein (2015) argues explicitly that analytic social metaphysics, provided its account of ontological ‘grounding’ is repaired in specific ways, can rescue social science from explanatory impasses into which he thinks it has fallen. This version of analytic social ontology thus directly competes with radically naturalistic alternatives, in a way that helps to clarify what makes some metaphysics genuinely scientific (that is, part of the scientific enterprise and worldview). I consider this competition, marshal considerations against the value to social science of analytic metaphysics, and sketch a contrasting scientific metaphysics for understanding the implications of revisionist social ontology in unified scientific ontology.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,15]]},"citation-key":"ross2023","container-title":"Synthese","DOI":"10.1007/s11229-023-04358-1","ISSN":"0039-7857","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,27]]},"language":"en","source":"typeset.io","title":"Scientific metaphysics and social science","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://typeset.io/papers/scientific-metaphysics-and-social-science-4lr9u9jwrb","volume":"202"},

In this work, we study the problem of predicting the category (domain) of arbitrary networks. This includes complex networks from different domains as well as synthetically generated graphs from six different network models. We formulate this problem as a multiclass classification problem and learn a model to predict the domain of a new previously unseen network using only a small set of simple structural features. The model is able to accurately predict the domain of arbitrary networks from 17 different domains with 95.7% accuracy. This work makes two important findings. First, our results indicate that complex networks from various domains have distinct structural properties that allow us to predict with high accuracy the category of a new previously unseen network. Second, synthetic graphs are trivial to classify as the classification model can predict with near-certainty the graph model used to generate it. Overall, the results demonstrate that networks drawn from different domains and graph models are distinguishable using a few simple structural features.","author":[{"family":"Rossi","given":"Ryan A."},{"family":"Ahmed","given":"Nesreen K."}],"citation-key":"rossi","container-title":"Social Network Analysis and Mining","DOI":"10.1007/s13278-019-0593-7","title":"Complex networks are structurally distinguishable by domain","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13278-019-0593-7?utm_source=researcher_app&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=RESR_MRKT_Researcher_inbound"},

Little is known, however, about how the prefrontal cortex (PFC), which subserves decision-making, combines these quantities. Here, using computational modelling and neuroimaging, we show that the ventromedial PFC encodes both reward expectations and proper beliefs about reward contingencies, while the dorsomedial PFC combines these quantities and guides choices that are at variance with those predicted by optimal decision theory: instead of integrating reward expectations with beliefs, the dorsomedial PFC built context-dependent reward expectations commensurable to beliefs and used these quantities as two concurrent appetitive components, driving choices. This neural mechanism accounts for well-known risk aversion effects in human decision-making. The results reveal that the irrationality of human choices commonly theorized as deriving from optimal computations over false beliefs, actually stems from suboptimal neural heuristics over rational beliefs about reward contingencies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Rouault","given":"Marion"},{"family":"Drugowitsch","given":"Jan"},{"family":"Koechlin","given":"Etienne"}],"citation-key":"rouault2019","container-title":"Nature Communications","container-title-short":"Nat Commun","DOI":"10.1038/s41467-018-08121-w","ISSN":"2041-1723","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",1,17]]},"language":"en","license":"2019 The Author(s)","note":"Bandiera_abtest: a\nCc_license_type: cc_by\nCg_type: Nature Research Journals\nPrimary_atype: Research\nSubject_term: Decision;Human behaviour\nSubject_term_id: decision;human-behaviour","number":"1","page":"301","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Prefrontal mechanisms combining rewards and beliefs in human decision-making","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-08121-w","volume":"10"},

But because nature is viewed only as a resource, sustainability fails to recognize that humans and other living beings depend on each other for their well-being. We therefore argue that true sustainability can only be achieved if the interdependent needs of all species of current and future generations are met, and propose calling this ‘multispecies sustainability’. We explore the concept through visualizations and scenarios, then consider how it might be applied through case studies involving bees and healthy green spaces.\n          , \n            Technical summary\n            The sustainability concept in its current form suffers from reductionism. The common interpretation of ‘meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs’ fails to explicitly recognize their interdependence with needs of current and future non-human generations. Here, we argue that the focus of sustainability on human well-being – a purely utilitarian view of nature as a resource for humanity – limits its conceptual and analytical power, as well as real-world sustainability transformation efforts. We propose a broadened concept of ‘multispecies sustainability’ by acknowledging interdependent needs of multiple species’ current and future generations. We develop the concept in three steps: (1) discussing normative aspects, fundamental principles underlying the concept, and potential visual models, (2) showcasing radically diverging futures emerging from a scenario thought experiment based on the axes sustainable-unsustainable and multispecies-anthropocentric, and (3) exploring how multispecies sustainability can be applied to research and policy-making through two case studies (a multispecies stakeholder framework and the Healthy Urban Microbiome Initiative).\n          , \n            Social media summary\n            A new multispecies definition of sustainability recognizes that living beings and their wellbeing are interdependent.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Rupprecht","given":"Christoph D.

These traditions have remained largely separate despite partly overlapping concerns and similar underlying strategies of argumentation. They have also both been the subject of similar criticisms based on naturalistic approaches to the philosophy of science, which have addressed their apparent reliance on a transcendental mode of reasoning, their seeming distance from social scientific practice, and their (erroneous?) tendency to advocate global solutions to local and pragmatic problems. Two approaches aiming to naturalize these two traditions of social ontology have been proposed in recent years: one drawing on a Gierean, model-based approach to scientific practice, the other drawing on inference to the best explanation.

First, naturalistic metaphysicians have argued that our best science provides an important source of evidence for metaphysical theories.

Katherine Hawley has recently argued that, unlike the natural sciences, the social sciences are not sufficiently successful to provide evidence about the metaphysical nature of social entities.

At the end of her discussion, she reaches a rather pessimistic conclusion, especially as regards the IBE approach: “a number of phenomena indicate that the prospects for securely basing social metaphysics via inference to the best explanation from social science are currently faint. […] We need to look elsewhere if we are to develop a metaphysics of the social world.” In my comments on her paper, I try to re-animate the program of an inductive metaphysics by defending the idea that the method of inference to the best explanation (IBE method) should be the central method of justification for metaphysics in general and for social metaphysics in particular.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",5,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Scholz","given":"Oliver R."}],"citation-key":"scholz2018","container-title":"Journal for General Philosophy of Science","container-title-short":"J Gen Philos Sci","DOI":"10.1007/s10838-018-9399-y","ISSN":"1572-8587","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",6,1]]},"language":"en","page":"199-210","source":"Springer Link","title":"Inductive Social Metaphysics—A Defence of Inference to the Best Explanation in the Metaphysics of Social Reality: Comments on Katherine Hawley","title-short":"Inductive Social Metaphysics—A Defence of Inference to the Best Explanation in the Metaphysics of Social Reality","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10838-018-9399-y","volume":"49"},

The goal of this paper is to defend the theory of generalized evolution (GE) against criticisms by laying down its theoretical principles and their applications in a unified way. Section 2 develops GE theory and its realization in biological evolution (BE) and cultural evolution (CE). The core of GE theory consists of the three Darwinian principles together with the models of population dynamics (PD). Section 3 reconstructs the most important differences between BE and CE. While BE is predominantly based on the replication of genes, CE is based on the reproduction of memes. Memes are understood as the informational “software” of human brains transmitted through social learning processes. The ontology of memes and the concept of cultural fitness is carved out and refined. Finally, section 4 articulates the minimal ontological assumptions of GE theory and the quantitative principles of generalized PD that unify biological PD and evolutionary game theory.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",5,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Schurz","given":"Gerhard"}],"citation-key":"schurz2021","container-title":"American Philosophical Quarterly","DOI":"10.2307/48600688","ISSN":"0003-0481","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"95-110","publisher":"Duke University Press","source":"scholarlypublishingcollective.org","title":"EVOLUTION IN NATURE AND CULTUREPROSPECTS AND PROBLEMS OF GENERALIZED EVOLUTION THEORY","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://scholarlypublishingcollective.org/uip/apq/article/58/1/95/255938/EVOLUTION-IN-NATURE-AND-CULTUREPROSPECTS-AND","volume":"58"},
  {"id":"schwartenbeck2015","abstract":"Classical economic models are predicated on the idea that the ultimate aim of choice is to maximize utility or reward. In contrast, an alternative perspective highlights the fact that adaptive behavior requires agents’ to model their environment and minimize surprise about the states they frequent. We propose that choice behavior can be more accurately accounted for by surprise minimization compared to reward or utility maximization alone. Minimizing surprise makes a prediction at variance with expected utility models; namely, that in addition to attaining valuable states, agents attempt to maximize the entropy over outcomes and thus ‘keep their options open’. We tested this prediction using a simple binary choice paradigm and show that human decision-making is better explained by surprise minimization compared to utility maximization. Furthermore, we replicated this entropy-seeking behavior in a control task with no explicit utilities. These findings highlight a limitation of purely economic motivations in explaining choice behavior and instead emphasize the importance of belief-based motivations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Schwartenbeck","given":"Philipp"},{"family":"FitzGerald","given":"Thomas H.

This ‘cultural minds’ hypothesis has proved highly influential, and if it is correct it is a major step forward in understanding how and why humans have survived and prospered in a hugely diverse range of ecologies. It can be contrasted with a ‘social minds’ hypothesis, according to which cultural transmission occurs as an outcome, but not the biologically evolved function, of social cognition the domain of which is relatively small-group interaction.

  {"id":"searle2010","abstract":"There are few more important philosophers at work today than John Searle, a creative and contentious thinker who has shaped the way we think about mind and language. Now he offers a profound understanding of how we create a social reality--a reality of money, property, governments, marriages, stock markets and cocktail parties. The paradox he addresses in Making the Social World is that these facts only exist because we think they exist and yet they have an objective existence. Continuing a line of investigation begun in his earlier book The Construction of Social Reality, Searle identifies the precise role of language in the creation of all \"institutional facts.\" His aim is to show how mind, language and civilization are natural products of the basic facts of the physical world described by physics, chemistry and biology. Searle explains how a single linguistic operation, repeated over and over, is used to create and maintain the elaborate structures of human social institutions. These institutions serve to create and distribute power relations that are pervasive and often invisible. These power relations motivate human actions in a way that provides the glue that holds human civilization together. Searle then applies the account to show how it relates to human rationality, the freedom of the will, the nature of political power and the existence of universal human rights. In the course of his explication, he asks whether robots can have institutions, why the threat of force so often lies behind institutions, and he denies that there can be such a thing as a \"state of nature\" for language-using human beings.","author":[{"family":"Searle","given":"John"}],"citation-key":"searle2010","ISBN":"978-0-19-974586-9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",1,12]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"358","publisher":"Oxford University Press","source":"Google Books","title":"Making the Social World: The Structure of Human Civilization","title-short":"Making the Social World","type":"book"},

  {"id":"sebanz2021","abstract":"Humans have a striking ability to coordinate their actions with each other to achieve joint goals. The tight interpersonal coordination that characterizes joint actions is achieved through processes that help with preparing for joint action as well as processes that are active while joint actions are being performed. To prepare for joint action, partners form representations of each other’s actions and tasks and the relation between them. This enables them to predict each other’s upcoming actions, which, in turn, facilitates coordination. While performing joint actions, partners’ coordination is maintained by (a) monitoring whether individual and joint outcomes correspond to what was planned, (b) predicting partners’ action parameters on the basis of familiarity with their individual actions, (c) communicating task-relevant information unknown to partners in an action-based fashion, and (d) relying on coupling of predictions through dense perceptual-information flow between coactors. The next challenge for the field of joint action is to generate an integrated perspective that links coordination mechanisms to normative, evolutionary, and communicative frameworks.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Sebanz","given":"Natalie"},{"family":"Knoblich","given":"Günther"}],"citation-key":"sebanz2021","container-title":"Current Directions in Psychological Science","container-title-short":"Curr Dir Psychol Sci","DOI":"10.1177/0963721420984425","ISSN":"0963-7214","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",4,1]]},"language":"en","page":"138-143","publisher":"SAGE Publications Inc","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Progress in Joint-Action Research","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0963721420984425","volume":"30"},

Developing a typology based upon the existing literature, we identify three branches of cognitive sociology in France. The first was initiated by Raymond Boudon, one of the scholars most responsible for popularizing the area, who envisioned cognitive sociology as helping delineate the role of beliefs in rational action. Second, another group of researchers seeks to found sociology upon a naturalistic basis, thus drawing upon the disciplines constitutive of cognitive science (e.g., psychology, cognitive neuroscience, and cognitive anthropology). Finally, the third approach to cognitive sociology in France takes inspiration from linguistics as a foundation for sociological investigations. We conclude the paper by discussing the relationship between these three sub-fields and by examining the relationship between French and American cognitive sociologies in order to identify fruitful directions for future research.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",8,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Sepulvado","given":"Brandon"},{"family":"Lizardo","given":"Omar"}],"citation-key":"sepulvado2017","container-title":"The American Sociologist","container-title-short":"Am Soc","DOI":"10.1007/s12108-017-9341-5","ISSN":"1936-4784","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"366-381","source":"Springer Link","title":"Cognitive Sociology in France","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12108-017-9341-5","volume":"48"},

First it states that the informational view which dominates the study of animal communication leads to cut apart the biological, the cognitive and the social parts of social communication. When it comes to human nonverbal communication, it is difficult then to articulate its biological and the cultural dimensions. Following Ingold I argue that in order to go beyond the “natural pattern vs cultural rules or meaning” conception of human nonverbal communication, we need to rely on a relational view. But what is a relational view in the study of communication? In the final part of the paper, I suggest that social relationships are both subjective and objective entities and, drawing on an original paper by Kaufmann and Clément (2008, in press), I offer a hypothesis on how social communication could operate to objectively and subjectively organize the construction of social relationships.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",1,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Servais","given":"Véronique"}],"citation-key":"servais2007","container-title":"Intellectica.

Habituation experiments demonstrate that monkeys compare vocalizations according to their referents, not just their acoustic properties: vervets who learned to ignore playback of a starling's raptor alarm subsequently also ignored playback of a vervet's eagle alarm. Experiments also demonstrate that vervets are sensitive to the breadth of referential specificity exhibited by different calls.

Many theorists have thought that the resources of mathematical information theory are all that are needed to capture the meaning or content that is being communicated in these systems. However, the way theorists routinely talk about the models implicitly draws on a conception of content that is richer than bare informational content, especially in contexts where false content is important. This article shows that this concept can be made precise by defining a notion of functional content that captures the degree to which different states of the world are involved in stabilizing senders’ and receivers’ use of a signal at equilibrium.

It takes coordination as the main ontological unit of the social, a mechanism homological across animals and humans, for both can handle coordination problems: in the forms of “animal conventions” and social institutions, respectively. On this account, institutions are correlated equilibria with normative force. However, if both humans and animals solve coordination problems in a similar way, and only humans have social institutions, how do the latter evolve? I suggest identifying possible causes of this evolution among cognitive capacities like mindreading and imitation by building dynamic models. Social ontology becomes constrained by the evolution of the forms of coordination and by the cognitive mechanisms involved in the emergence and persistence of social institutions. It means that it becomes bound to what might be derived from social institutions, i.e., social roles, structures and their derivatives. It shows how conceptual relations might emerge from causal.

Our treatment of convention is grounded in Lewis’s (1969) seminal account; we do not here redefine convention, but rather explore the space of possibilities within Lewis’s definition, highlighting certain types of variation that Lewis de-emphasized. Applied to the case of indirect requests, which we view through a Searlean lens, the notion of natural convention allows us to give a nuanced answer to the question: Are indirect requests conventional? In conclusion, we reflect on the consequences of our view for the understanding of the semantics/pragmatics divide.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Simons","given":"Mandy"},{"family":"Zollman","given":"Kevin J.

Individual agents begin to interact at random, with the interactions modeled as games. The game payoffs determine which interactions are reinforced, and the network structure emerges as a consequence of the dynamics of the agents' learning behavior. We study this in a variety of game-theoretic conditions and show that the behavior is complex and sometimes dissimilar to behavior in the absence of structural dynamics. We argue that modeling network structure as dynamic increases realism without rendering the problem of analysis intractable.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Skyrms","given":"Brian"},{"family":"Pemantle","given":"Robin"}],"citation-key":"skyrms2004","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.math/0404101","issued":{"date-parts":[["2004",4,5]]},"number":"arXiv:math/0404101","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"A Dynamic Model of Social Network Formation","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0404101"},

  {"id":"smith1976","abstract":"A theoretical analysis is made of the evolution of behavioural strategies in contest situations. It is assumed that behaviour will evolve so as to maximize individual fitness. If so, a population will evolve an ‘evolutionarily stable strategy’, or ESS, which can be defined as a strategy such that, if all members of a population adopt it, no ‘mutant’ strategy can do better. A number of simple models of contest situations are analysed from this point of view. It is concluded that in ‘symmetric’ contests the ESS is likely to be a ‘mixed’ strategy; that is, either the population will be genetically polymorphic or individuals will be behaviourally variable. Most real contests are probably asymmetric, either in pay-off to the contestants, or in size or weapons, or in some ‘uncorrelated’ fashion; i.e. in a fashion which does not substantially bias either the pay-offs or the likely outcome of an escalated contest. An example of an uncorrelated asymmetry is that between the ‘discoverer’ of a resource and a ‘late-comer’. It is shown that the ESS in asymmetric contests will usually be to permit the asymmetric cue to settle the contest without escalation. Escalated contests will, however, occur if information to the contestants about the asymmetry is imperfect.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Smith","given":"John Maynard"},{"family":"Parker","given":"G.

  {"id":"smith2022","abstract":"The active inference framework, and in particular its recent formulation as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), has gained increasing popularity in recent years as a useful approach for modeling neurocognitive processes. This framework is highly general and flexible in its ability to be customized to model any cognitive process, as well as simulate predicted neuronal responses based on its accompanying neural process theory. It also affords both simulation experiments for proof of principle and behavioral modeling for empirical studies. However, there are limited resources that explain how to build and run these models in practice, which limits their widespread use. Most introductions assume a technical background in programming, mathematics, and machine learning. In this paper we offer a step-by-step tutorial on how to build POMDPs, run simulations using standard MATLAB routines, and fit these models to empirical data. We assume a minimal background in programming and mathematics, thoroughly explain all equations, and provide exemplar scripts that can be customized for both theoretical and empirical studies. Our goal is to provide the reader with the requisite background knowledge and practical tools to apply active inference to their own research. We also provide optional technical sections and multiple appendices, which offer the interested reader additional technical details. This tutorial should provide the reader with all the tools necessary to use these models and to follow emerging advances in active inference research.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Smith","given":"Ryan"},{"family":"Friston","given":"Karl J."},{"family":"Whyte","given":"Christopher J."}],"citation-key":"smith2022","container-title":"Journal of Mathematical Psychology","container-title-short":"Journal of Mathematical Psychology","DOI":"10.1016/j.jmp.2021.102632","ISSN":"0022-2496","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",4,1]]},"language":"en","page":"102632","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"A step-by-step tutorial on active inference and its application to empirical data","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022249621000973","volume":"107"},

Psychological considerations are crucial both to a proper characterization of what is cultural and to a proper explanation of cultural phenomena. The chapter suggests that a properly naturalistic approach to social and cultural phenomena centrally involves identifying the causal factors and mechanisms that shape these causal chains and explaining the macroregularities and changes of social and cultural life in term of these microprocesses. It also argues that cognition enables culture through domain-specific constructive mechanisms. Cognitive processes are linked to one another in causal chains such chains are Cognitive Causal Chains (CCCs). Social Cognitive Causal Chains (SCCC) that have the function of preserving mental content, behavioral form, or both, may extend across many individual and through a social group, distributing throughout this group similar mental representations or public productions. Such representations and productions are cultural and the SCCCs that distribute them are cultural CCCs.","author":[{"family":"Sperber","given":"Dan"}],"citation-key":"sperber2006","container-title":"Roots of Human Sociality","ISBN":"978-1-003-13551-7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2006"]]},"number-of-pages":"19","publisher":"Routledge","title":"Why a Deep Understanding of Cultural Evolution is Incompatible with Shallow Psycholgoy","type":"chapter"},

  {"id":"sperry-taylor2021","abstract":"Equilibrium explanations use an equilibrium to represent and explain a system’s dynamic behavior. They provide a system with the property of global stability: a system will converge towards and remain in equilibrium regardless of its initial conditions and dynamic process. Thus, equilibrium explanations are generally treated as non-causal explanations. There are two claims subsumed under that comprehensive thesis. The first claim is that equilibrium explanations do not identify any causes because a system with global stability resists manipulation. The second claim is that even if equilibrium explanations do identify causes by manipulation, those causes are embedded in a system’s deeper, underlying structural relationships, and those causes are irrelevant to explaining a system’s behavior. Only the system’s structural relationships are relevant. But equilibrium explanations are not monolithic. I compare dynamic systems with multiple, competing equilibria to systems with a globally stable equilibrium. Equilibrium explanations of the former use intervention on a system’s initial conditions and dynamic process to manipulate equilibria, which identifies causes. Furthermore, a system’s initial conditions and dynamic process are relevant to explaining why one equilibrium is selected instead of another. I then apply these lessons to systems with a globally stable equilibrium and discuss when their corresponding equilibrium explanations have a proper role in the parent sciences.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",5,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Sperry-Taylor","given":"Ashton T."}],"citation-key":"sperry-taylor2021","container-title":"Synthese","container-title-short":"Synthese","DOI":"10.1007/s11229-019-02423-2","ISSN":"1573-0964","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",6,1]]},"language":"en","page":"5577-5598","source":"Springer Link","title":"Reassessing equilibrium explanations: When are they causal explanations?","title-short":"Reassessing equilibrium explanations","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11229-019-02423-2","volume":"198"},

  {"id":"sprevak2024","abstract":"Predictive coding – sometimes also known as ‘predictive processing’, ‘free energy minimisation’, or ‘prediction error minimisation’ – claims to offer a complete, unified theory of cognition that stretches all the way from cellular biology to phenomenology. However, the exact content of the view, and how it might achieve its ambitions, is not clear. This series of articles examines predictive coding and attempts to identify its key commitments and justification. The present article begins by focusing on possible confounds with predictive coding: claims that are often identified with predictive coding, but which are not predictive coding. These include the idea that the brain employs an efficient scheme for encoding its incoming sensory signals; that perceptual experience is shaped by prior beliefs; that cognition involves minimisation of prediction error; that the brain is a probabilistic inference engine; and that the brain learns and employs a generative model of the world. These ideas have garnered widespread support in modern cognitive neuroscience, but it is important not to conflate them with predictive coding.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Sprevak","given":"Mark"}],"citation-key":"sprevak2024","container-title":"Philosophy Compass","DOI":"10.1111/phc3.12950","ISSN":"1747-9991","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024"]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2023 The Authors.

  {"id":"stalnaker1996","abstract":"Deliberation about what to do in any context requires reasoning about what will or would happen in various alternative situations, including situations that the agent knows will never in fact be realized. In contexts that involve two or more agents who have to take account of each others' deliberation, the counterfactual reasoning may become quite complex. When I deliberate, I have to consider not only what the causal effects would be of alternative choices that I might make, but also what other agents might believe about the potential effects of my choices, and how their alternative possible actions might affect my beliefs. Counterfactual possibilities are implicit in the models that game theorists and decision theorists have developed – in the alternative branches in the trees that model extensive form games and the different cells of the matrices of strategic form representations – but much of the reasoning about those possibilities remains in the informal commentary on and motivation for the models developed. Puzzlement is sometimes expressed by game theorists about the relevance of what happens in a game ‘off the equilibrium path’: of what would happen if what is (according to the theory) both true and known by the players to be true were instead false.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",11,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Stalnaker","given":"Robert"}],"citation-key":"stalnaker1996","container-title":"Economics & Philosophy","DOI":"10.1017/S0266267100004132","ISSN":"1474-0028, 0266-2671","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["1996",10]]},"language":"en","page":"133-163","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"Cambridge University Press","title":"Knowledge, Belief and Counterfactual Reasoning in Games","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/economics-and-philosophy/article/abs/knowledge-belief-and-counterfactual-reasoning-in-games/FDBA691FC298435C1638E407D1C09A1A","volume":"12"},

  {"id":"sterelny","abstract":"There is a very striking difference between even the simplest ethnographically known human societies and those of the chimps and bonobos. Chimp and bonobo societies are closed societies: with the exception of adolescent females who disperse from their natal group and join a nearby group (never to return to their group of origin), a <em class=\"EmphasisTypeItalic\">pan</em> residential group is the whole social world of the agents who make it up. That is not true of forager bands, which have fluid memberships, and regular associations with neighbouring bands. They are components of a larger social world. The open and fluid character of forager bands brings with it many advantages, so the stability of this more vertically complex form of social life is not difficult to explain, once it establishes. But how did it establish, if, as is likely, earlier hominin social worlds resemble those of our close <em class=\"EmphasisTypeItalic\">pan</em> relatives in the suspicion (even hostility) of one band to another? How did hominin social organisation transition from life in closed bands, each distrustful of its neighbours, to the much more open social lives of foragers? I will discuss and synthesise two approaches to this problem, one ecological, based on the work of Robert Layton and his colleagues, and another that is organised around an expansion of kin recognition, an idea primarily driven by Bernard Chapais. The paper closes by discussing potential archaeological signatures both of more open social worlds, and of the supposed causal drivers of such worlds.","author":[{"family":"Sterelny","given":"Kim"}],"citation-key":"sterelny","container-title":"Topoi","DOI":"10.1007/s11245-019-09666-1","title":"The Origins of Multi-level Society","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11245-019-09666-1?utm_source=researcher_app&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=RESR_MRKT_Researcher_inbound"},

  {"id":"sterelny2011","abstract":"This paper contributes to a debate in the palaeoarchaeological community about the major time-lag between the origin of anatomically modern humans and the appearance of typically human cultural behaviour. Why did humans take so long—at least 100 000 years—to become ‘behaviourally modern’? The transition is often explained as a change in the intrinsic cognitive competence of modern humans: often in terms of a new capacity for symbolic thought, or the final perfection of language. These cognitive breakthrough models are not satisfactory, for they fail to explain the uneven palaeoanthropological record of human competence. Many supposed signature capacities appear (and then disappear) before the supposed cognitive breakthrough; many of the signature capacities disappear again after the breakthrough. So, instead of seeing behavioural modernity as a simple reflection of a new kind of mind, this paper presents a niche construction conceptual model of behavioural modernity. Humans became behaviourally modern when they could reliably transmit accumulated informational capital to the next generation, and transmit it with sufficient precision for innovations to be preserved and accumulated. In turn, the reliable accumulation of culture depends on the construction of learning environments, not just intrinsic cognitive machinery. I argue that the model is (i) evolutionarily plausible: the elements of the model can be assembled incrementally, without implausible selective scenarios; (ii) the model coheres with the broad palaeoarchaeological record; (iii) the model is anthropologically and ethnographically plausible; and (iv) the model is testable, though only in coarse, preliminary ways.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Sterelny","given":"Kim"}],"citation-key":"sterelny2011","container-title":"Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","DOI":"10.1098/rstb.2010.0301","issue":"1566","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",3,27]]},"page":"809-822","publisher":"Royal Society","source":"royalsocietypublishing.org (Atypon)","title":"From hominins to humans: how sapiens became behaviourally modern","title-short":"From hominins to humans","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rstb.2010.0301","volume":"366"},

In this game, two agents interact. One agent can observe which of two equi-probable states the world is in, but that agent cannot act directly and profitably on that information. However, the informed agent can act in a way that will be perceptually salient to a second agent: say, by raising a red or a green flag. The second agent does have the capacity to respond appropriately to each state of the world. If that second agent chooses the right option, given the state of the world, both are rewarded. If the second agent fails to choose the right action, neither are. Obviously, the two agents are best off if they have a practice in which the informed agent regularly chooses a distinct, salient cue in response to each of the two world states, and in which the powerful agent uses that cue to select the rewarding act. Less obviously, agents with simple trial and error learning capacities can learn to signal and respond: neither explicit negotiation nor cognitive sophistication are required. Likewise, if individual agents do not have the capacity to learn, but if they breed true but with some variation, the evolutionary version of trial and error learning can take a population to one of the signalling system equilibria.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Sterelny","given":"Kim"}],"citation-key":"sterelny2012a","container-title":"Economics and Philosophy","container-title-short":"Economics and Philosophy","DOI":"10.1017/S0266267112000120","ISSN":"0266-2671, 1474-0028","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",3]]},"language":"en","page":"73-86","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"A glass half-full: Brian Skyrms's \"Signals\"","title-short":"A GLASS HALF-FULL","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/S0266267112000120/type/journal_article","volume":"28"},

  {"id":"sterelny2015","abstract":"Hutto and Satne identify three research traditions attempting to explain the place of intentional agency in a wholly natural world: naturalistic reduction; sophisticated behaviourism, and pragmatism, and suggest that insights from all three are necessary. While agreeing with that general approach, I develop a somewhat different package, offering an outline of a vindicating genealogy of our interpretative practices. I suggest that these practices had their original foundation in the elaboration of much more complex representation-guided control structures in our lineage and the support and amplification of those control structures through external resources. Cranes (as Dennett calls them) became increasingly important in the explanation of systematically successful action. These more complex representational engines coevolved with selection to detect and respond to the control structures of others. Since much of that selection was driven by the advantages of cooperation and coordination, in part these control structures were co-opted as external signals and guarantees, in cooperation and coordination. As the time depth of cooperation and co-ordination extended, these public signals of belief and intent acquired secondary functions, as mechanisms to stabilise and structure control systems, making humans not just more transparent to one another at a time, but more predictable over time. Mindshaping, not just mindreading, became increasingly important in our lineage.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",2,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Sterelny","given":"Kim"}],"citation-key":"sterelny2015","container-title":"Philosophia","container-title-short":"Philosophia","DOI":"10.1007/s11406-015-9628-0","ISSN":"1574-9274","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015"]]},"language":"en","page":"549-564","source":"Springer Link","title":"Content, Control and Display: The Natural Origins of Content","title-short":"Content, Control and Display","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11406-015-9628-0","volume":"43"},

In particular, it is assumed that social behavior is controlled by 2 interacting systems that follow different operating principles. The reflective system generates behavioral decisions that are based on knowledge about facts and values, whereas the impulsive system elicits behavior through associative links and motivational orientations. The proposed model describes how the 2 systems interact at various stages of processing, and how their outputs may determine behavior in a synergistic or antagonistic fashion. It extends previous models by integrating motivational components that allow more precise predictions of behavior. The implications of this reflective-impulsive model are applied to various phenomena from social psychology and beyond. Extending previous dual-process accounts, this model is not limited to specific domains of mental functioning and attempts to integrate cognitive, motivational, and behavioral mechanisms.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Strack","given":"Fritz"},{"family":"Deutsch","given":"Roland"}],"citation-key":"strack2004","container-title":"Personality and Social Psychology Review","container-title-short":"Pers Soc Psychol Rev","DOI":"10.1207/s15327957pspr0803_1","ISSN":"1088-8683","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2004",8,1]]},"language":"en","page":"220-247","publisher":"SAGE Publications Inc","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Reflective and Impulsive Determinants of Social Behavior","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1207/s15327957pspr0803_1","volume":"8"},

The chapters address its central themes, roughly organized along the temporal axis of information processing. They include basic operations like perception, categorization, representation, and judgmental inferences. Other chapters focus on issues like social comparison, emotion, language and culture. All of the contributors are internationally-renowned experts who share with the reader their accounts of the research experience in each of their domains. Social Cognition: The Basis of Human Interaction is an invaluable resource for researchers requiring a comprehensive, yet concise, overview of the field, and may also be used by intermediate and advanced students of social cognition.","author":[{"family":"Strack","given":"Fritz"},{"family":"Förster","given":"Jens"}],"citation-key":"strack2011","ISBN":"978-1-136-87417-8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",2,25]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"347","publisher":"Psychology Press","source":"Google Books","title":"Social Cognition: The Basis of Human Interaction","title-short":"Social Cognition","type":"book"},
  {"id":"strasser2018","abstract":"Human and non-human animals are social beings, both have social interactions. The ability to anticipate behavior of others is a fundamental requirement of social interactions. However, there are several ways of how agents can succeed in this. Two modes of anticipation, namely mindreading and behavior-reading, shape the animal mindreading debate. As a matter of fact, no position has yet convincingly ruled out the other. This paper suggests a strategy of how to argue for a mentalistic interpretation as opposed to a behavioral interpretation. The first step suggests considering a pluralistic approach in order to allow for shortcomings such as not having a natural language. Second, a critical examination of the principle called Morgan’s Canon will show that this principle cannot be used as a final argument to rule out mentalistic approaches. Finally, the author argues that the setting of current experiments is responsible for the indistinguishability of mindreading versus behavior-reading and she suggests alternative experimental designs.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Strasser","given":"Anna"}],"citation-key":"strasser2018","container-title":"Grazer Philosophische Studien","container-title-short":"Grazer Philos.

  {"id":"suarez2019","abstract":"Philippe Huneman ha cuestionado recientemente los límites en la aplicación de los modelos mecanicistas de la explicación científica en base a la existencia de lo que denomina \"explicaciones estructurales\", en las que el fenómeno se explica en virtud de las propiedades matemáticas del sistema en que el fenómeno ocurre. Las explicaciones estructurales pueden darse en formas muy diversas: en virtud de la forma de pajarita (bowtie) de la estructura, de las propiedades topológicas del sistema, de los equilibrios alcanzados, etc. El papel que juegan las matemáticas en las explicaciones que apelan a la estructura de pajarita o a las propiedades topológicas del sistema ha sido recientemente examinado en varios trabajos. Sin embargo, el papel exacto que juegan las matemáticas en el caso de las explicaciones en términos de equilibrio aún no ha sido totalmente clarificado, y diferentes autores defienden interpretaciones contradictorias, algunas de las cuales las asemejarían más al modelo defendido por algunos filósofos mecanicistas que al modelo estructural de Huneman. En este trabajo, tratamos de cubrir ese déficit estudiando el papel que juegan las matemáticas en el modelo de equilibrio anidado (nested equilibrium) elaborado por Blaser y Kirchner para explicar la estabilidad de las asociaciones ontogenética y filogenéticamente persistentes entre humanos y microorganismos. De nuestro análisis se desprende que su modelo es explicativo porque i) se identifica una estructura matemática del sistema que viene dada por un conjunto de ecuaciones diferenciales que satisfacen una estrategia evolutivamente estable; ii) la estructura anidada del modelo hace que la estrategia evolutivamente estable sea robusta ante posibles perturbaciones; iii) esto es así porque las propiedades del sistema empírico son isomorfas a, pero no causalmente responsables de, las propiedades de la estrategia evolutivamente estable. La combinación de estas tres tesis hace que las explicaciones en términos de equilibrios se asemejen más al modelo estructural de explicación que al modelo mecanístico. Philippe Huneman has recently questioned the widespread application of mechanistic models of scientific explanation based on the existence of structural explanations, i.e. explanations that account for the phenomenon to be explained in virtue of the mathematical properties of the system where the phenomenon obtains, rather than in terms of the mechanisms that causally produce the phenomenon. Structural explanations are very diverse, including cases like explanations in terms of bowtie structures, in terms of the topological properties of the system, or in terms of equilibrium. The role of mathematics in bowtie structured systems and in topologically constrained systems has recently been examined in different papers. However, the specific role that mathematical properties play in equilibrium explanations requires further examination, as different authors defend different interpretations, some of them closer to the new-mechanistic approach than to the structural model advocated by Huneman. In this paper, we cover this gap by investigating the explanatory role that mathematics play in Blaser and Kirschner's nested equilibrium model of the stability of persistent long-term human-microbe associations. We argue that their model is explanatory because: i) it provides a mathematical structure in the form of a set of differential equations that together satisfy an ESS; ii) that the nested nature of the ESSs makes the explanation of host-microbe persistent associations robust to any perturbation; iii) that this is so because the properties of the ESS directly mirror the properties of the biological system in a non-causal way. The combination of these three theses make equilibrium explanations look more similar to structural explanations than to causal-mechanistic explanation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",5,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Suárez","given":"Javier"},{"family":"Deulofeu","given":"Roger"}],"citation-key":"suarez2019","container-title":"Teorema: Revista Internacional de Filosofía","ISSN":"0210-1602","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"page":"95-120","publisher":"[KRK Ediciones, SL, Luis Manuel Valdés-Villanueva]","source":"JSTOR","title":"Equilibrium Explanation as Structural Non-Mechanistic Explanations: The Case of Long-Term Bacterial Persistence in Human Hosts","title-short":"Equilibrium Explanation as Structural Non-Mechanistic Explanations","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/26874514","volume":"38"},

Here we first distinguish basic prospection, such as associative learning, from more complex prospection commonly observed in humans, such as episodic foresight, the ability to imagine diverse future situations and organize current actions accordingly. We review recent studies on complex prospection in various contexts, such as decision-making, planning, deliberate practice, information gathering, and social coordination. Prospection appears to play many important roles in human survival and reproduction. Foreseeing threats and opportunities before they arise, for instance, drives attempts at avoiding future harm and obtaining future benefits, and recognizing the future utility of a solution turns it into an innovation, motivating refinement and dissemination. Although we do not know about the original contexts in which complex prospection evolved, it is increasingly clear through research on the emergence of these capacities in childhood and on related disorders in various clinical conditions, that limitations in prospection can have profound functional consequences. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","archive":"Scopus","author":[{"family":"Suddendorf","given":"T."},{"family":"Bulley","given":"A."},{"family":"Miloyan","given":"B."}],"citation-key":"suddendorf2018","container-title":"Current Opinion in Behavioral Sciences","DOI":"10.1016/j.cobeha.2018.01.019","ISSN":"2352-1546","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"page":"26-31","source":"Scopus","title":"Prospection and natural selection","type":"article-journal","volume":"24"},

Each player chooses a decision rule which, for each possible private description, picks one of the available strategy labels.

  {"id":"taylor2022","abstract":"Touchscreen apps have the potential to teach children important early skills including oral language. However, there is little empirical data assessing the educational potential of children's apps in the app market or how apps link to theories of cognitive development to support learning. We compared popular children's apps with a learning goal (N=18) and without (N=26) using systematic evaluation tools to assess the educational potential and app features that may support learning. We also transcribed all utterances in the apps that included language with a learning goal (N=18) and without (N=12) in order to compare a number of psycholinguistic measures relating to accessibility of the language. Apps with a learning goal had higher educational potential, more opportunities for feedback, a higher proportion of ostensive feedback, and age-appropriate language to support learning and language development. Thus, we argue that selecting children's apps based on the presence of a learning goal is a good first step for selecting an educational app for pre-school age children. Nevertheless, app developers could do more to promote exploratory app use, adjust content to a child's performance, and make use of social interactions with characters onscreen in their apps to enhance the educational potential. Children's apps could also make better use of feedback to ensure that it is specific, meaningful and constructive to better facilitate learning.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Taylor","given":"Gemma"},{"family":"Kolak","given":"Joanna"},{"family":"Norgate","given":"Sarah H."},{"family":"Monaghan","given":"Padraic"}],"citation-key":"taylor2022","container-title":"Computers and Education Open","container-title-short":"Computers and Education Open","DOI":"10.1016/j.caeo.2022.100102","ISSN":"2666-5573","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,1]]},"page":"100102","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Assessing the educational potential and language content of touchscreen apps for preschool children","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666557322000313","volume":"3"},

Innovations can give access to new opportunities, and thus enable innovating agents to invade and create novel niches. This in turn can pave the way for morphological adaptation and adaptive radiation. The mechanisms that make innovations possible are probably as diverse as the innovations themselves. So too are their evolutionary consequences. Perhaps because of this diversity, we lack a unifying framework that links mechanism to function. We propose a framework for animal innovation that describes the interactions between mechanism, fitness benefit and evolutionary significance, and which suggests an expanded range of experimental approaches. In doing so, we split innovation into factors (components and phases) that can be manipulated systematically, and which can be investigated both experimentally and with correlational studies.

At the heart of this idea is a different take on social metaphysics from most standard current accounts in that it begins with empirical, phylogenetic capacities of human beings for social practices (realizing abstract thought in the world) as well as relationality (the need for attachments to others). The combination of these two essential human capacities, what I call the practical-relational nexus, is generative of more complex social reality. The ontogeny of any social reality is the result of the ways that this practical-relational nexus has been organized and shaped by external social structures and systems, themselves the product of certain kinds of social power.

In this paper, we start from a simple foundation, an elemental model system for social interactions, whose behavior has been captured in the Haken-Kelso-Bunz (HKB) model. We follow a tried and tested scientific method that tightly interweaves experimental neurobehavioral studies and mathematical models. We use this method to further develop a body of empirical research that advances the theory toward more generalized forms. In concordance with this interdisciplinary spirit, the present paper is written both as an overview of relevant advances and as an introduction to its mathematical underpinnings. We demonstrate HKB’s evolution in the context of social coordination along several directions, with its applicability growing to increasingly complex scenarios. In particular, we show that accommodating for symmetry breaking in intrinsic dynamics and coupling, multiscale generalization and adaptation are principal evolutions. We conclude that a general framework for social coordination dynamics is on the horizon, in which models support experiments with hypothesis generation and mechanistic insights. © Copyright © 2020 Tognoli, Zhang, Fuchs, Beetle and Kelso.","archive":"Scopus","author":[{"family":"Tognoli","given":"E."},{"family":"Zhang","given":"M."},{"family":"Fuchs","given":"A."},{"family":"Beetle","given":"C."},{"family":"Kelso","given":"J.A.S."}],"citation-key":"tognoli2020","container-title":"Frontiers in Human Neuroscience","DOI":"10.3389/fnhum.2020.00317","ISSN":"1662-5161","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"source":"Scopus","title":"Coordination Dynamics: A Foundation for Understanding Social Behavior","title-short":"Coordination Dynamics","type":"article-journal","volume":"14"},
  {"id":"tomasello2010","abstract":"A leading expert on evolution and communication presents an empirically based theory of the evolutionary origins of human communication that challenges the dominant Chomskian view.Human communication is grounded in fundamentally cooperative, even shared, intentions. In this original and provocative account of the evolutionary origins of human communication, Michael Tomasello connects the fundamentally cooperative structure of human communication (initially discovered by Paul Grice) to the especially cooperative structure of human (as opposed to other primate) social interaction. Tomasello argues that human cooperative communication rests on a psychological infrastructure of shared intentionality (joint attention, common ground), evolved originally for collaboration and culture more generally. The basic motives of the infrastructure are helping and sharing: humans communicate to request help, inform others of things helpfully, and share attitudes as a way of bonding within the cultural group. These cooperative motives each created different functional pressures for conventionalizing grammatical constructions. Requesting help in the immediate you-and-me and here-and-now, for example, required very little grammar, but informing and sharing required increasingly complex grammatical devices. Drawing on empirical research into gestural and vocal communication by great apes and human infants (much of it conducted by his own research team), Tomasello argues further that humans' cooperative communication emerged first in the natural gestures of pointing and pantomiming. Conventional communication, first gestural and then vocal, evolved only after humans already possessed these natural gestures and their shared intentionality infrastructure along with skills of cultural learning for creating and passing along jointly understood communicative conventions. Challenging the Chomskian view that linguistic knowledge is innate, Tomasello proposes instead that the most fundamental aspects of uniquely human communication are biological adaptations for cooperative social interaction in general and that the purely linguistic dimensions of human communication are cultural conventions and constructions created by and passed along within particular cultural groups.","author":[{"family":"Tomasello","given":"Michael"}],"citation-key":"tomasello2010","ISBN":"978-0-262-26120-3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",8,13]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"409","publisher":"MIT Press","source":"Google Books","title":"Origins of Human Communication","type":"book"},
  {"id":"tomasello2014","abstract":"Tool-making or culture, language or religious belief: ever since Darwin, thinkers have struggled to identify what fundamentally differentiates human beings from other animals. Michael Tomasello weaves his twenty years of comparative studies of humans and great apes into a compelling argument that cooperative social interaction is the key to our cognitive uniqueness. Tomasello maintains that our prehuman ancestors, like today's great apes, were social beings who could solve problems by thinking. But they were almost entirely competitive, aiming only at their individual goals. As ecological changes forced them into more cooperative living arrangements, early humans had to coordinate their actions and communicate their thoughts with collaborative partners. Tomasello's \"shared intentionality hypothesis\" captures how these more socially complex forms of life led to more conceptually complex forms of thinking. In order to survive, humans had to learn to see the world from multiple social perspectives, to draw socially recursive inferences, and to monitor their own thinking via the normative standards of the group. Even language and culture arose from the preexisting need to work together and coordinate thoughts. A Natural History of Human Thinking is the most detailed scientific analysis to date of the connection between human sociality and cognition.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",2,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Tomasello","given":"Michael"}],"citation-key":"tomasello2014","DOI":"10.4159/9780674726369","ISBN":"978-0-674-72636-9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",2,17]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Harvard University Press","source":"www.degruyter.com","title":"A Natural History of Human Thinking","type":"book","URL":"https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.4159/9780674726369/html"},

This article contributes to the discussion by suggesting an alternative approach to computer simulations in the social realm. Instead of representing reality, simulations are seen as a way of boosting abstraction by enabling us to isolate and study the effects of emergent mechanisms. The need for such tools is growing more urgent in an age characterized by rapid change and global networks of causal interrelation. Hence there is a need not only for new tools to deal with causal complexity within critical realism, but also for a critical realist perspective to fill the meta‐theoretical vacuum on which the simulation approach is largely based. The approach developed here provides a challenge to the predominant ways in which simulations are utilized today, with increasingly sophisticated models aiming towards realistic representation on the basis of empirical data.</p>","author":[{"family":"Törnberg","given":"Anton"}],"citation-key":"tornberg","container-title":"Journal for the Theory of Social Behaviour","DOI":"10.1111/jtsb.12194","title":"Abstractions on steroids: A critical realist approach to computer simulations","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jtsb.12194?af=R"},
  {"id":"torok2019","abstract":"When people perform simple actions, they often behave efficiently, minimizing the costs of movement for the expected benefit. The present study addressed the question of whether this efficiency scales up to dyads working together to achieve a shared goal: Do people act efficiently as a group (i.e., coefficiently), or do they minimize their own or their partner’s individual costs even if this increases the overall cost for the group? We devised a novel, touch-screen-based, sequential object-transfer task to measure how people choose between different paths to coordinate with a partner. Across multiple experiments, we found that participants did not simply minimize their own or their partner’s movement costs but made coefficient decisions about paths, which ensured that the aggregate costs of movement for the dyad were minimized. These results suggest that people are able and motivated to make coefficient, collectively rational decisions when acting together.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Török","given":"Georgina"},{"family":"Pomiechowska","given":"Barbara"},{"family":"Csibra","given":"Gergely"},{"family":"Sebanz","given":"Natalie"}],"citation-key":"torok2019","container-title":"Psychological Science","container-title-short":"Psychol Sci","DOI":"10.1177/0956797619842550","ISSN":"0956-7976","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",6,1]]},"language":"en","page":"930-941","publisher":"SAGE Publications Inc","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Rationality in Joint Action: Maximizing Coefficiency in Coordination","title-short":"Rationality in Joint Action","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0956797619842550","volume":"30"},

Specifically, using a dot-probe detection paradigm, White participants revealed biased attention toward Black faces relative to White faces (Study 1). Because the faces were presented only briefly (30-ms), the bias is thought to reflect the early engagement of attention. The attentional bias was eliminated, however, when the faces displayed averted eye-gaze (Study 2). That is, when the threat communicated by the Black faces was attenuated by a relevant, competing socio-emotional cue—in this case, averted eye-gaze—they no longer captured perceivers’ attention. Broader implications for social cognition, as well as public policies that reify these prevailing perceptions of young Black men are discussed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Trawalter","given":"Sophie"},{"family":"Todd","given":"Andrew R."},{"family":"Baird","given":"Abigail A."},{"family":"Richeson","given":"Jennifer A."}],"citation-key":"trawalter2008","container-title":"Journal of Experimental Social Psychology","container-title-short":"Journal of Experimental Social Psychology","DOI":"10.1016/j.jesp.2008.03.006","ISSN":"0022-1031","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008",9,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1322-1327","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Attending to threat: Race-based patterns of selective attention","title-short":"Attending to threat","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103108000401","volume":"44"},

  {"id":"tuomela2013","abstract":"Social ontology, in its broadest sense, is the study of the nature of social reality, including collective intentions and agency. The starting point of Tuomela's account of collective intentionality is the distinction between thinking and acting as a private person (\"I-mode\") versus as a \"we-thinking\" group member (\"we-mode\"). The we-mode approach is based on social groups consisting of persons, which may range from simple task groups consisting of a few persons to corporations and even to political states. Tuomela extends the we-mode notion to cover groups controlled by external authority. Thus, for instance, cooperation and attitude formation are studied in cases where the participants are governed \"from above\" as in many corporations. The volume goes on to present a systematic philosophical theory related to the collectivism-versus-individualism debate in the social sciences. A weak version of collectivism (the \"we-mode\" approach) depends on group-based collective intentionality. We-mode collective intentionality is not individualistically reducible and is needed to complement individualistic accounts in social scientific theorizing. The we-mode approach is used in the book to account for collective intention and action, cooperation, group attitudes, and social practices and institutions, as well as group solidarity. Tuomela establishes the first complete theory of group reasons (in the sense of members' reasons for participation in group activities). The book argues in terms of game-theoretical group-reasoning that the kind of weak collectivism that the we-mode approach involves is both conceptually and rational-functionally different from what an individualistic approach (\"pro-group I-mode\" approach) entails.","author":[{"family":"Tuomela","given":"Raimo"}],"citation-key":"tuomela2013","ISBN":"978-0-19-997827-4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",8,23]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"327","publisher":"Oxford University Press","source":"Google Books","title":"Social Ontology: Collective Intentionality and Group Agents","title-short":"Social Ontology","type":"book"},

Turner focuses especially on connectionism, which views learning as a process of adaptation to input that, in turn, leads to patterns of response distinct to each individual. This means that there is no common \"server\" from which people download shared frameworks that enable them to cooperate or communicate. Therefore, argues Turner, \"practices\"—in the sense that the term is widely used in the social sciences and humanities—is a myth, and so are the \"cultures\" that are central to anthropological and sociological thought.  In a series of tightly argued essays, Turner traces out the implications that discarding the notion of shared frameworks has for relativism, social constructionism, normativity, and a number of other concepts. He suggests ways in which these ideas might be reformulated more productively, in part through extended critiques of the work of scholars such as Ian Hacking, Andrew Pickering, Pierre Bourdieu, Quentin Skinner, Robert Brandom, Clifford Geertz, and Edward Shils.","author":[{"family":"Turner","given":"Stephen"}],"citation-key":"turner2002","ISBN":"978-0-226-81740-8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2002",5]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"232","publisher":"University of Chicago Press","source":"Google Books","title":"Brains/Practices/Relativism: Social Theory After Cognitive Science","title-short":"Brains/Practices/Relativism","type":"book"},

  {"id":"unakafov","abstract":"Real-world agents, humans as well as animals, observe each other during interactions and choose their own actions taking the partners' ongoing behaviour into account. Yet, classical game theory assumes that players act either strictly sequentially or strictly simultaneously without knowing each other's current choices. To account for action visibility and provide a more realistic model of interactions under time constraints, we introduce a new game-theoretic setting called transparent games, where each player has a certain probability of observing the partner's choice before deciding on its own action. By means of evolutionary simulations, we demonstrate that even a small probability of seeing the partner's choice before one's own decision substantially changes the evolutionary successful strategies. Action visibility enhances cooperation in an iterated coordination game, but reduces cooperation in a more competitive iterated Prisoner's Dilemma. In both games, \"Win–stay, lose–shift\" and \"Tit-for-tat\" strategies are predominant for moderate transparency, while a \"Leader-Follower\" strategy emerges for high transparency. Our results have implications for studies of human and animal social behaviour, especially for the analysis of dyadic and group interactions.\nHumans and animals constantly make social decisions. Should an animal during group foraging or a human at the buffet try to obtain an attractive food item but risk a confrontation with a dominant conspecific, or is it better to opt for a less attractive but non-confrontational choice, especially when considering that the situation will repeat in the future? To model decision-making in such situations game theory is widely used. However, classic game theory assumes that agents act either at the same time, without knowing each other's choices, or one after another. In contrast, humans and animals usually try to take the behaviour of their opponents and partners into account, to instantaneously adjust their own actions if possible. To provide a more realistic model of decision making in a social setting, we here introduce the concept of transparent games. It integrates the probability of observing the partner's instantaneous actions into the game-theoretic framework of knowing previous choice outcomes. We find that such \"transparency\" has a direct influence on the emergence of cooperative behaviours in classic iterated games. The transparent games can contribute to a deeper understanding of social behaviour and decision-making of humans and animals.","author":[{"family":"Unakafov","given":"Anton M."},{"family":"Schultze","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Gail","given":"Alexander"},{"family":"Moeller","given":"Sebastian"},{"family":"Kagan","given":"Igor"},{"family":"Eule","given":"Stephan"},{"family":"Wolf","given":"Fred"}],"citation-key":"unakafov","container-title":"PLOS Computational Biology","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007588","title":"Emergence and suppression of cooperation by action visibility in transparent games","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.1007588&utm_source=researcher_app&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=RESR_MRKT_Researcher_inbound"},
  {"id":"upadhyay2023","abstract":"Frugal innovation can be understood as the net positive result created in social contexts by implementing novel and low-resource-intensive products and services. Such products and services are uniquely suited to tackle the problems faced in low-income and marginalised contexts. Marginalised contexts are social scenarios where people have low income, low capabilities and lack access to infrastructure and institutional support. Frugal innovation can provide appropriate solutions at significantly lesser costs and with fewer resources, thus being suitable for such contexts. Although several guidelines for frugal innovation exist, well-defined approaches for its conceptualization and design, especially for marginalised contexts, are still emerging in the literature. This research presents theoretical outcomes and attempts to define an approach for frugal innovation in marginalised contexts by meeting some of the lacunae identified in existing approaches. The paper reports an in-depth retrospective case study analysis of four cases where authors had first-hand experience designing and developing frugal solutions for marginalised contexts. Project documentation, outcomes and designers' experiences in these four cases were critically analysed using known design guidelines to identify novel design strategies for effectively executing a design process. These design strategies and the insights from reviewing existing approaches were used to formulate a framework called ‘Frugal Design for Marginalised Context’. The framework is intended to function as a support to help practitioners implement the identified strategies systematically and effectively. The framework can help designers create holistic, frugal and meaningful solutions for social scenarios. The identified strategies can also be used as guidelines for planning design projects that tackle ill-defined and socially relevant design problems in marginalised contexts.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Upadhyay","given":"Pankaj"},{"family":"Punekar","given":"Ravi Mokashi"}],"citation-key":"upadhyay2023","container-title":"Journal of Cleaner Production","container-title-short":"Journal of Cleaner Production","DOI":"10.1016/j.jclepro.2023.137170","ISSN":"0959-6526","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,15]]},"page":"137170","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"A framework for designing frugal innovations in marginalised contexts","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652623013288","volume":"410"},

The chapter discusses an alternate definition of convention as a correlated equilibrium satisfying a public intentions criterion (PIC), and argues that this definition is more satisfactory than Lewis' definition.

  {"id":"vanderschraaf1998","abstract":"There are two general classes of social conventions: conventions of coordination, and conventions of partial conflict. In coordination problems, the interests of the agents coincide, while in partial conflict problems, some agents stand to gain only if other agents unilaterally make certain sacrifices. Lewis' (1969) pathbreaking analysis of convention in terms of game theory focuses on coordination problems, and cannot accommodate partial conflict problems. In this paper, I propose a new game-theoretic definition of convention which generalizes previous game-theoretic definitions (Lewis 1969, Vanderschraaf 1995), and which can be used to characterize norms of justice in partial conflict situations. I argue that the key structural property necessary for a social arrangement to be a convention is that it be conditionally self-enforcing, in the sense that: (i) each agent has a decisive reason to follow her end of the arrangement given that she expects all to do likewise, (ii) given a different set of expectations, some agents would have had a decisive reason to deviate, and (iii) these facts are common knowledge. This leads to a definition of convention as a strict correlated equilibrium (Aumann 1974) together with appropriate common knowledge conditions. Examples are given in which it is shown how this more general account of convention can be used to analyze norms of justice as well as coordination problems.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",11,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Vanderschraaf","given":"P."}],"citation-key":"vanderschraaf1998","container-title":"Erkenntnis","container-title-short":"Erkenntnis","DOI":"10.1023/A:1005461514200","ISSN":"1572-8420","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["1998",11,1]]},"language":"en","page":"337-369","source":"Springer Link","title":"Knowledge, Equilibrium and Convention","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1005461514200","volume":"49"},

Starting with the work of Barry (1965), Runciman and Sen (1965) and Lewis (1969), there has been a flowering of literature on the informal game-theoretic insights to be found in classics of political philosophy such as Hobbes (1651), Locke (1690), Hume (1740) and Rousseau (1755). A number of authors in this tradition, including Lewis (1969), Gauthier (1979), Mackie (1980), and Postema (1995), have identified passages in Hume which they interpret as giving informal examples of specific games. Yet, unlike his predecessors, Hobbes and Locke, Hume does much more than present examples which have a game-theoretic structure. In his account of convention, Hume gives general conditions which characterize the\n              resolution\n              of social interaction problems, and in the examples he uses to illustrate this account, Hume outlines several different methods by which agents can arrive at such a resolution.

This would seem a trivial statement, but I believe that taking it seriously is more complicated than it appears to be, as I argue in this article. Elsewhere, I proposed the notion of “bounded functionality” As a way to describe the constraints that should be considered when trying to understand the evolution of the brain. There are two bounded-functionality constraints that are essential to any evolution-minded approach to cognitive neuroscience. The first constraint, the bricoleur constraint, describes the evolutionary pressure for any adaptive solution to re-use any relevant resources available to the system before the selection situation appeared. The second constraint, the satisficing constraint, describes the fact that a trait only needs to behave more advantageously than its competitors in order to be selected. In this paper I describe how bounded-functionality can inform an evolutionary-minded approach to cognitive neuroscience. In order to do so, I resort to Nikolaas Tinbergen’s four questions about how to understand behavior, namely: function, causation, development and evolution. The bottom line of assuming Tinbergen’s questions is that any approach to cognitive neuroscience is intrinsically tentative, slow, and messy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Vilarroya","given":"Oscar"}],"citation-key":"vilarroya2021","container-title":"NeuroSci","DOI":"10.3390/neurosci2020013","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",6]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","number":"2","page":"177-192","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"Nothing in Cognitive Neuroscience Makes Sense Except in the Light of Evolution","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2673-4087/2/2/13","volume":"2"},

In response, I set out to build on those theories and provide a (more) comprehensive naturalistic account of the emergence, persistence and evolution of social contracts. My central claim is that social contracts have culturally evolved to solve cooperation problems, which include both coordination and competition problems.

However, the evolution of meaning is contingent on both the particular sender–receiver game played and the choice of evolutionary dynamic. In this paper I explore some differences between models that presume an infinitely large and randomly mixed population and models in which a finite number of agents communicate with their neighbors in a social network. My results show that communication with neighbors is more conducive to the evolution of meaning than communication with strangers. Additionally, I show that the behavior of the system is highly dependent on the topological structure of the social network. I argue that a specific class of networks—small world graphs—is especially conducive to the evolution of meaning. This is because small world graphs have a short characteristic path length while still maintaining a high degree of correlation between neighbors. Since many actual social networks, such as friendship networks and nervous systems, are conjectured to be small world structures, these results indicate that these networks are quite hospitable to the efficient evolution of meaning.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Wagner","given":"Elliott"}],"citation-key":"wagner2009","container-title":"Erkenntnis","container-title-short":"Erkenn","DOI":"10.1007/s10670-009-9157-y","ISSN":"1572-8420","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",11,1]]},"language":"en","page":"377-393","source":"Springer Link","title":"Communication and Structured Correlation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10670-009-9157-y","volume":"71"},

In particular, I investigate a signalling game in which messages are free, the state-act payoffs resemble rock–paper–scissors, and senders and receivers adjust their strategies according to the replicator dynamic. This system exhibits Hamiltonian chaos and trajectories do not converge to equilibria. This persistent out-of-equilibrium behaviour results in messages that do not perfectly reveal the sender's private information, but do transfer information as quantified by the Kullback–Leibler divergence. This finding shows that adaptive dynamics can enable information transmission even though messages at equilibria are meaningless.

However, these not only represent the local realms, as they are embedded in glocal networks. Urban development takes place in them through different forms of self-organisation, primarily outside the formal planning processes and official institutions, varying in terms of temporality and stages of emergence. We argue that expanded urban planning, which is based on pluralist realism, opens up methodological opportunities for a more agile and responsive planning system, potentially leading to more inclusive urban development. The comparative analyses indicate that the application of flat ontology comprises an expansion of the extent of planning, the importance of temporal dynamics in all stages of planning, the adoption of a variety of digital and non-digital methods and tools, as well as skilful deliberation of complex relations between assemblages.

In relation with methodological individualism, it considers the benefits of studying the genesis of an institution in a game theoretic framework. First, an institution may be obtained as an equilibrium by a voluntary procedure, which introduces an auxiliary game with regard to the main game. Second, it may be interpreted as the equilibrium resulting from an eductive process, where the players’ reasoning stays implicit or becomes explicit. Third, it may be analyzed as the equilibrium resulting from an evolutionary process, either belief based learning or reinforcement learning. Some problems stay unsolved, for instance the collective naturalization and the normatization of the institution.","author":[{"family":"Walliser","given":"Bernard"}],"citation-key":"walliser2006","language":"en","page":"24","title":"GAME THEORY AND EMERGENCE OF INSTITUTIONS","type":"article-journal"},

The strong version entails that the same concepts that are sufficient to explain basic minds (with non-representational states) are also central to understanding non-basic minds (with representational states). We argue that recent work on the free energy principle supports the following claims with respect to the life-mind continuity thesis: (i) there is a strong continuity between life and mind; (ii) all living systems can be described as if they had representational states; (iii) the ’as-if representationality’ entailed by the free energy principle is central to understanding both basic forms of intentionality and intentionality in non-basic minds. In addition to this, we argue that the free energy principle also renders realism about computation and representation compatible with a strong life-mind continuity thesis (although the free energy principle does not entail computational and representational realism). In particular, we show how representationality proper can be grounded in ’as-if representationality’.","author":[{"literal":"Wanja Wiese"},{"family":"Wiese","given":"Wanja"},{"literal":"Karl J.

  {"id":"warren2022","abstract":"This work proposes a mentalized approach to questions, investigations, and interpretations of non-human primate communication, which contextualize the role and utility of the inferential communication model, and provides a detailed breakdown of the possible levels of cognitive complexity which could be investigated using this framework. Communication, when defined as an act intended to affect the psychological state of another individual, demands the use of inference. Either the signaler, the recipient, or both must make leaps of understanding which surpass the semantic information available and draw from pragmatic clues to fully imbue and interpret meaning. While research into human communication and the evolution of language has long been comfortable with mentalistic interpretations of communicative exchanges, including rich attributions of mental state, research into animal communication has balked at theoretical models which describe mentalized cognitive mechanisms. We submit a new theoretical perspective on animal communication: the model of inferential communication. For use when existing proximate models of animal communication are not sufficient to fully explain the complex, flexible, and intentional communication documented in certain species, specifically non-human primates, we present our model as a bridge between shallower, less cognitive descriptions of communicative behavior and the perhaps otherwise inaccessible mentalistic interpretations of communication found in theoretical considerations of human language. Inferential communication is a framework that builds on existing evidence of referentiality, intentionality, and social inference in primates. It allows that they might be capable of applying social inferences to a communicative setting, which could explain some of the cognitive processes that enable the complexity and flexibility of primate communication systems. While historical models of animal communication focus on the means-ends process of behavior and apparent cognitive outcomes, inferential communication invites consideration of the mentalistic processes that must underlie those outcomes. We propose a mentalized approach to questions, investigations, and interpretations of non-human primate communication. We include an overview of both ultimate and proximate models of animal communication, which contextualize the role and utility of our inferential communication model, and provide a detailed breakdown of the possible levels of cognitive complexity which could be investigated using this framework. Finally, we present some possible applications of inferential communication in the field of non-human primate communication and highlight the role it could play in advancing progress toward an increasingly precise understanding of the cognitive capabilities of our closest living relatives.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Warren","given":"Elizabeth"},{"family":"Call","given":"J."}],"citation-key":"warren2022","container-title":"Frontiers in Psychology","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"language":"en","source":"www.semanticscholar.org","title":"Inferential Communication: Bridging the Gap Between Intentional and Ostensive Communication in Non-human Primates","title-short":"Inferential Communication","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Inferential-Communication%3A-Bridging-the-Gap-Between-Warren-Call/b9d1205e583f1bcd6dcf7e2655d3ddc5bdd8e4fc"},

We propose that an additional, hitherto-unarticulated law is required to characterize familiar macroscopic phenomena of our complex, evolving universe. An important feature of the classical laws of physics is the conceptual equivalence of specific characteristics shared by an extensive, seemingly diverse body of natural phenomena. Identifying potential equivalencies among disparate phenomena—for example, falling apples and orbiting moons or hot objects and compressed springs—has been instrumental in advancing the scientific understanding of our world through the articulation of laws of nature. A pervasive wonder of the natural world is the evolution of varied systems, including stars, minerals, atmospheres, and life. These evolving systems appear to be conceptually equivalent in that they display three notable attributes: 1) They form from numerous components that have the potential to adopt combinatorially vast numbers of different configurations; 2) processes exist that generate numerous different configurations; and 3) configurations are preferentially selected based on function. We identify universal concepts of selection—static persistence, dynamic persistence, and novelty generation—that underpin function and drive systems to evolve through the exchange of information between the environment and the system. Accordingly, we propose a “law of increasing functional information”: The functional information of a system will increase (i.e., the system will evolve) if many different configurations of the system undergo selection for one or more functions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Wong","given":"Michael L."},{"family":"Cleland","given":"Carol E."},{"family":"Arend","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Bartlett","given":"Stuart"},{"family":"Cleaves","given":"H.

His theory is a manipulationist account, proposing that causal and explanatory relationships are relationships that are potentially exploitable for purposes of manipulation and control. This account has its roots in the commonsense idea that causes are means for bringing about effects; but it also draws on a long tradition of work inexperimental design, econometrics, and statistics. Woodward shows how these ideas may be generalized to other areas of science from the social scientific and biomedical contexts for which they were originally designed. He also provides philosophical foundations for the manipulationist approach, drawing out its implications, comparing it withalternative approaches, and defending it from common criticisms. In doing so, he shows how the manipulationist account both illuminates important features of successful causal explanation in the natural and social sciences, and avoids the counterexamples and difficulties that infect alternativeapproaches, from the deductive-nomological model onwards.

  {"id":"xie2023","abstract":"The interaction between teachers and students is vital for promoting teaching quality. Online learning spaces have various features that can support teacher-student interaction in online learning contexts. In this study, a preliminary model was developed by analyzing the principles underlying the interaction between teachers and students and the support features of online learning spaces. Then, the interaction model was refined and validated in three rounds of teaching practice involving 31 college students.

  {"id":"yi2021","abstract":"Epigenetic information affects gene function by interacting with chromatin, while not changing the DNA sequence itself. However, it has become apparent that the interactions between epigenetic information and chromatin can, in fact, indirectly lead to DNA mutations and ultimately influence genome evolution. This review evaluates the ways in which epigenetic information affects genome sequence and evolution. We discuss how DNA methylation has strong and pervasive effects on DNA sequence evolution in eukaryotic organisms. We also review how the physical interactions arising from the connections between histone proteins and DNA affect DNA mutation and repair. We then discuss how a variety of epigenetic mechanisms exert substantial effects on genome evolution by suppressing the movement of transposable elements. Finally, we examine how genome expansion through gene duplication is also partially controlled by epigenetic information. Overall, we conclude that epigenetic information has widespread indirect effects on DNA sequences in eukaryotes and represents a potent cause and constraint of genome evolution.\n\nThis article is part of the theme issue ‘How does epigenetics influence the course of evolution?’","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Yi","given":"Soojin V."},{"family":"Goodisman","given":"Michael A.

  {"id":"ylikoski2010","abstract":"Comparisons of rival explanations or theories often involve vague appeals to explanatory power. In this paper, we dissect this metaphor by distinguishing between different dimensions of the goodness of an explanation: nonsensitivity, cognitive salience, precision, factual accuracy and degree of integration. These dimensions are partially independent and often come into conﬂict. Our main contribution is to go beyond simple stipulation or description by explicating why these factors are taken to be explanatory virtues. We accomplish this by using the contrastive-counterfactual approach to explanation and the view of understanding as an inferential ability. By combining these perspectives, we show how the explanatory power of an explanation in a given dimension can be assessed by showing the range of answers it provides to what-if-things-had-been-different questions and the theoretical and pragmatic importance of these questions. Our account also explains intuitions linking explanation to uniﬁcation or to exhibition of a mechanism.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",11,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Ylikoski","given":"Petri"},{"family":"Kuorikoski","given":"Jaakko"}],"citation-key":"ylikoski2010","container-title":"Philosophical Studies","container-title-short":"Philos Stud","DOI":"10.1007/s11098-008-9324-z","ISSN":"0031-8116, 1573-0883","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",3]]},"language":"en","page":"201-219","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Dissecting explanatory power","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11098-008-9324-z","volume":"148"},

The main concern is to reveal how different coordination mechanisms rely on specific epistemic aspects of reasoning. The paper highlights the fact that basic epistemic assumptions of theories diverge in a way that makes them essentially distinctive. Consequently, recommendations and predictions of the traditional views of coordination by salience are, in principle, based on the processes related to the agent’s presumptions regarding the cognitive abilities of a co-player.

I argue that if one rejects this assumption in favor of the view that interpretation in terms of mental states also plays important regulative roles with respect to minds and behavior, a new and superior conception of the relationship between metacognition and social cognition comes into view. On this conception, person-level metacognitive concepts are socio-cognitive tools that shape us into better cognitive agents and more predictable cognitive objects, thereby enhancing our abilities at social coordination. Mastery of these metacognitive concepts relies on subpersonal, non-conceptual, procedural metacognition.

  {"id":"zotero-169","abstract":"Interactions among individuals in natural populations often occur in a dynamically changing environment. Understanding the role of environmental variation in population dynamics has long been a central topic in theoretical ecology and population biology. However, the key question of how individuals, in the middle of challenging social dilemmas (e.g. the 'tragedy of the commons'), modulate their behaviours to adapt to the fluctuation of the environment has not yet been addressed satisfactorily. Using evolutionary game theory, we develop a framework of stochastic games that incorporates the adaptive mechanism of reinforcement learning to investigate whether cooperative behaviours can evolve in the ever-changing group interaction environment. When the action choices of players are just slightly influenced by past reinforcements, we construct an analytical condition to determine whether cooperation can be favoured over defection. Intuitively, this condition reveals why and how the environment can mediate cooperative dilemmas. Under our model architecture, we also compare this learning mechanism with two non-learning decision rules, and we find that learning significantly improves the propensity for cooperation in weak social dilemmas, and, in sharp contrast, hinders cooperation in strong social dilemmas. Our results suggest that in complex social–ecological dilemmas, learning enables the adaptation of individuals to varying environments.","citation-key":"zotero-169","container-title":"Journal of the Royal Society Interface","DOI":"10.1098/rsif.2020.0639","title":"Learning enables adaptation in cooperation for multi-player stochastic games","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rsif.2020.0639?af=R&utm_source=researcher_app&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=RESR_MRKT_Researcher_inbound"},

  {"id":"zotero-1808","abstract":"Social ontological inquiry has been pursued in analytic philosophy as well as in the social scientific tradition of critical realism. These traditions have remained largely separate despite partly overlapping concerns and similar underlying strategies of argumentation. They have also both been the subject of similar criticisms based on naturalistic approaches to the philosophy of science, which have addressed their apparent reliance on a transcendental mode of reasoning, their seeming distance from social scientific practice, and their (erroneous?) tendency to advocate global solutions to local and pragmatic problems. Two approaches aiming to naturalize these two traditions of social ontology have been proposed in recent years: one drawing on a Gierean, model-based approach to scientific practice, the other drawing on inference to the best explanation. In our paper, we compare and contrast these naturalistic approaches to social ontology in terms of their capacity to respond to the aforementioned challenges. We also defend a form of methodological pluralism, according to which there are multiple different naturalistically acceptable approaches to social ontology, which emphasize contrasting procedural continuities between social scientific research and philosophical practice.","citation-key":"zotero-1808","container-title":"Synthese","DOI":"10.1007/s11229-023-04105-6","title":"Two approaches to naturalistic social ontology","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11229-023-04105-6?utm_source=researcher_app&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=RESR_MRKT_Researcher_inbound"},
  {"id":"zotero-1875","abstract":"There's a general assumption that teleology and function do not exist in inanimate nature. Throughout biology, it is generally taken as granted that teleology (or teleonomy) and functions are not only unique to life, but perhaps even a defining quality of life. For many, it's obvious that rocks, water, and the like, are not teleological, nor could they possibly have stand-alone functions. This idea - that teleology and function are unique to life - is the target of this paper. I begin with an overview of McShea's  \nfield theoretic \n account of teleology. I start with the field theoretic account because it presents a promising analysis of teleological systems. It is promising because, in not making any assumptions about life's special status in teleological systems, it avoids counterexamples that have problematized other accounts. I then consider some of the prominent efforts that some have made to avoid ascribing functions or teleology to some form of inanimate nature. In my assessment, none of the efforts are successful. I conclude by offering mineral evolution as a case study to show how inanimate nature can be both teleological and functional. The evolution of mineral species reveals that teleology and function extend to inanimate nature, and that teleology and function come in degrees.","citation-key":"zotero-1875","container-title":"Synthese","DOI":"10.1007/s11229-023-04099-1","title":"Teleology and function in non-living nature","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11229-023-04099-1?utm_source=researcher_app&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=RESR_MRKT_Researcher_inbound"},

We use oral history as one of the methodological tools to gather the empirical material, conducting interviews with physicists working in systems biology. The interviews were conducted at several institutions in Brazil, Germany, Israel and the U.S. Biological research has been increasingly dependent on computational methods, high-throughput technologies, and multidisciplinary skills. Quantitative scientists are joining biological departments and collaborations between physicists and biologists are particularly vigorous. This state of affairs raises a number of questions, such as: What are the circumstances under which physicists approach biological problems in systems biology? What kind of interdisciplinary challenges must be tackled? The paper suggests that, concerning physicists' move to work on biological systems, there are common reasons to move, the transition must be understood in terms of degrees, physicists have a rationale for simplifying systems, and distinct conceptions of model and modeling strategies are recurrent. We identified problems regarding linguistic clarity and integration of epistemological aims. We conclude that cultural unconformities within the systems biology community have important consequences to the flow of scientific knowledge.","citation-key":"zotero-234","container-title":"European Journal for Philosophy of Science","DOI":"10.1007/s13194-019-0254-8","title":"From physics to biology: physicists in the search for systemic biological explanations","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13194-019-0254-8?utm_source=researcher_app&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=RESR_MRKT_Researcher_inbound"},

  {"id":"zotero-25","abstract":"This volume concerns the longstanding intellectual puzzle of how individuals overcome their biological, neural, and mental finitude to achieve sociality. It explores how humans take each other into account, coordinate their actions, and are able to share their inner states and to communicate. Sophisticated views on the bases of sociality are detailed at the level of neural mechanisms, perception and memory, motivation, communication and dialog, culture, and evolution. These insights have been inspired by major strides and exciting new developments in disciplines as far afield as ethology, evolutionary ecology, neuroscience, cognition, memory, developmental and social psychology, psycholinguistics, philosophy, robotics, and sociology. The volume is the first to bridge these disciplinary boundaries to lay the foundations for an integrated and general conceptualization of the bases of sociality and its implications for psychology. Each contribution presents different levels of the grounding of sociality and will further stimulate novel approaches to linking different layers of sociality, from the neural to the cultural level.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,19]]},"citation-key":"zotero-25","source":"books.google.ru","title":"Grounding Sociality","type":"book","URL":"https://books.google.com/books/about/Grounding_Sociality.html?hl=ru&id=fzZ5AgAAQBAJ"},

  {"id":"zotero-513","abstract":"Recent work in the cognitive sciences has argued that beliefs sometimes acquire signaling functions in virtue of their ability to reveal information that manipulates \"mindreaders.\" This paper sketches some of the evolutionary and design considerations that could take agents from solipsistic goal pursuit to beliefs that serve as social signals. Such beliefs will be governed by norms besides just the traditional norms of epistemology (e.g., truth and rational support). As agents become better at detecting the agency of others, either through evolutionary history or individual learning, the candidate pool for signaling expands. This logic holds for natural and artificial agents that find themselves in recurring social situations that reward the sharing of one's thoughts.","citation-key":"zotero-513","container-title":"Synthese","DOI":"10.1007/s11229-021-03412-0","title":"Evolutionary psychology, learning, and belief signaling: design for natural and artificial systems","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/article/article/article/10.1007/s11229-021-03412-0?utm_source=researcher_app&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=RESR_MRKT_Researcher_inbound"},
  {"id":"zotero-514","abstract":"In recent years, biologists and philosophers of science have argued that evolutionary theory should incorporate more seriously the idea of 'reciprocal causation.' This notion refers to feedback loops whereby organisms change their experiences of the environment or alter the physical properties of their surroundings. In these loops, in particular niche constructing activities are central, since they may alter selection pressures acting on organisms, and thus affect their evolutionary trajectories. This paper discusses long-standing problems that emerge when studying such reciprocal causal processes between organisms and environments. By comparing past approaches to reciprocal causation from the early twentieth century with contemporary ones in niche construction theory, we identify two central reoccurring problems: All of these approaches have not been able to provide a conceptual framework that allows (i) maintaining meaningful boundaries between organisms and environments, instead of merging the two, and (ii) integrating experiential and physical kinds of reciprocal causation. By building on case studies of niche construction research, we provide a model that is able to solve these two problems. It allows distinguishing between mutually interacting organisms and environments in complex scenarios, as well as integrating various forms of experiential and physical niche construction.","citation-key":"zotero-514","container-title":"Biology and Philosophy","DOI":"10.1007/s10539-021-09815-0","title":"Unknotting reciprocal causation between organism and environment","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/article/article/article/10.1007/s10539-021-09815-0?utm_source=researcher_app&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=RESR_MRKT_Researcher_inbound"},
  {"id":"zotero-516","abstract":"The article aims to provide the main conceptual coordinates in order to fully understand the state of the art of the most recent research in the field of neurobiology of interpersonal experience. The main purpose of this work is to analyze, at an anthropological, phenomenological and epistemological level, how the fundamental characteristics of the recognition of otherness and intercorporeity among human beings contribute to changing the image of nature in the light of a possible new relationship between living bodies, neurophysiological systems and empathy. From this point of view, the hypothesis to investigate is that neurophenomenology, understood as a new evolutionary, multidimensional and autopoietic approach, is capable of probing the preconditions of the possible delineation of a phenomenology of intersubjectivity shaped by the neuroscientific turning point, represented by the discovery of mirror neurons. At this level, the neuroscientific data are interpreted according to a specific interdisciplinary perspective, thus trying to offer a possible unitary and integrated theoretical framework.","citation-key":"zotero-516","container-title":"Axiomathes","DOI":"10.1007/s10516-021-09590-3","title":"Neurophenomenology and Intersubjectivity: An Interdisciplinary Approach","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/article/article/article/10.1007/s10516-021-09590-3?utm_source=researcher_app&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=RESR_MRKT_Researcher_inbound"},
  {"id":"zotero-517","abstract":"In everyday situations, and particularly in some sport and working contexts, humans face an inherently unpredictable and uncertain environment. All sorts of unpredictable and unexpected things happen but typically people are able to skillfully adapt. In this paper, we address two key questions in cognitive science. First, how is an agent able to bring its previously learned skill to bear on a novel situation? Second, how can an agent be both sensitive to the particularity of a given situation, while remaining flexibly poised for many other possibilities for action? We will argue that both the sensitivity to novel situations and the sensitivity to a multiplicity of action possibilities are enabled by the property of skilled agency that we will call  \nmetastable attunement \n. We characterize a skilled agent's flexible interactions with a dynamically changing environment in terms of metastable dynamics in agent-environment systems. What we find in metastability is the realization of two competing tendencies: the tendency of the agent to express their intrinsic dynamics and the tendency to search for new possibilities. Metastably attuned agents are ready to engage with a multiplicity of affordances, allowing for a balance between stability and flexibility. On the one hand, agents are able to exploit affordances they are attuned to, while at the same time being ready to flexibly explore for other affordances. Metastable attunement allows agents to smoothly transition between these possible configurations so as to adapt their behaviour to what the particular situation requires. We go on to describe the role metastability plays in learning of new skills, and in skilful behaviour more generally. Finally, drawing upon work in art, architecture and sports science, we develop a number of perspectives on how to investigate metastable attunement in real life situations.","citation-key":"zotero-517","container-title":"Synthese","DOI":"10.1007/s11229-021-03355-6","title":"Metastable attunement and real-life skilled behavior","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/article/article/article/10.1007/s11229-021-03355-6?utm_source=researcher_app&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=RESR_MRKT_Researcher_inbound"},
  {"id":"zotero-520","abstract":"Due to its high degree of complexity and its historical nature, evolutionary biology has been traditionally portrayed as a  \nmessy \n science. According to the supporters of such a view, evolutionary biology would be unable to formulate laws and robust theories, instead just delivering coherent narratives and local models. In this article, our aim is to challenge this view by showing how the Price equation can work as the core of a general theoretical framework for evolutionary phenomena. To support this claim, we outline some unnoticed structural similarities between physical theories (in particular, classical mechanics) and evolutionary biology. More specifically, we shall argue that the Price equation, in the same way as fundamental formalisms in physics, can serve as a heuristic principle to formulate and systematise different theories and models in evolutionary biology.","citation-key":"zotero-520","container-title":"Synthese","DOI":"10.1007/s11229-021-03339-6","title":"The mirror of physics: on how the price equation can unify evolutionary biology","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/article/article/article/10.1007/s11229-021-03339-6?utm_source=researcher_app&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=RESR_MRKT_Researcher_inbound"},
  {"id":"zotero-521","abstract":"Non-causal accounts of action explanation have long been criticized for lacking a positive thesis, relying primarily on negative arguments to undercut the standard Causal Theory of Action (Wilson and Shpall , in: Zalta (ed) The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, 2016). Additionally, it is commonly thought that non-causal accounts fail to provide an answer to Donald Davidson's (1963) challenge for theories of reasons explanations of actions. According to Davidson's challenge, a plausible non-causal account of reasons explanations must provide a way of connecting an agent's reasons, not only to what she ought to do, but to what she actually does. That is, such explanations must be truth-apt, not mere rationalizations. My aim in this paper is to show how a non-causal account of action can provide explanations that are truth-apt and genuinely explanatory. To make this argument, I take as a given an account of the practical syllogism (the syllogistic form of practical reasoning) discussed by Michael Thompson (Life and action: elementary structures of practice and practical thought, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, 2008) and Eric Wiland (Reasons, Continuum, New York, 2012), according to which the practical syllogism is  \ntruly practical \n rather than propositional in nature. Next, I present my primary positive thesis: reasons for actions have explanatory power in virtue of being parts of a  \nstructure \n—the practical syllogism—that contains the action being explained. I then argue that structural action explanations can meet Davidson's challenge and that they genuinely explain actions. Finally, I conclude by addressing some objections to my argument.","citation-key":"zotero-521","container-title":"Synthese","DOI":"10.1007/s11229-021-03349-4","title":"Reasons explanations (of actions) as structural explanations","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/article/article/article/10.1007/s11229-021-03349-4?utm_source=researcher_app&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=RESR_MRKT_Researcher_inbound"},
  {"id":"zotero-522","abstract":"Unless one embraces activities as foundational, understanding activities in mechanisms requires an account of the means by which entities in biological mechanisms engage in their activities—an account that does not merely explain activities in terms of more basic entities and activities. Recent biological research on molecular motors (myosin and kinesin) exemplifies such an account, one that explains activities in terms of free energy and constraints. After describing the characteristic \"stepping\" activities of these molecules and mapping the stages of those steps onto the stages of the motors' hydrolytic cycles, researchers pieced together from images of the molecules in different hydrolyzation states accounts of how the chemical energy in ATP is transformed in the constrained environments of the motors into the characteristic activities of the motors. We argue that New Mechanism's standard set of analytic categories—entities (parts), activities (operations), and organization—should be expanded to include constraints and energetics. Not only is such an expansion required descriptively to capture research on molecular motors but, more importantly from a philosophical point of view, it enables a non-regressive account of activities in mechanisms. In other words, this expansion enables a philosophical account of mechanistic explanation that avoids a regress of entities and activities \"all the way down.\" Rather, mechanistic explanation bottoms out in constraints and energetics.","citation-key":"zotero-522","container-title":"Synthese","DOI":"10.1007/s11229-021-03350-x","title":"Active biological mechanisms: transforming energy into motion in molecular motors","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/article/article/article/10.1007/s11229-021-03350-x?utm_source=researcher_app&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=RESR_MRKT_Researcher_inbound"},
