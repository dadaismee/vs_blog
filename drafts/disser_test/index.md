## Introduction
 Ontology studies “what there is” in the world: what exists genuinely and nonredundantly [@baker2019]. Any science strives to answer this question. Ontological commitments shape scientific explanations, implicitly or explicitly, and explanatory power of theories reflects its ontological assumptions. The choice of study methods, in its turn, reflects an intended way of explanation and demonstrates a commitment to a particular "version of the world" [@moon2014][^hughes].

<!--[^explanation]: @bunge1997 rejects the distinction of explanation and understanding, arguing that the former depends on the latter: *"I understand a fact F if and only if I know a satisfactory explanation of F. … E is a satisfactory explanation of F if and only if E involves a well-confirmed or at least plausible mechanism compatible with the known laws (or norms). … Therefore I understand fact F if and only if I know a verified or at least plausible mechanism for F"* [-bunge1997, 456].-->

 [^hughes]: As @hughes1990 argues, *"To use a questionnaire, to use an attitude scale, to take the role of participant observer, to select a random sample, to measure rates of population growth and so on, is to be involved in conceptions of the world which allow these instruments to be used for the purposes conceived. No technique or method of investigation (and this is as true of the natural sciences as it is of the social) is self-validating: its effectiveness, i.e. its very status as a research instrument making the world tractable to investigation, is, from a philosophical point of view, ultimately dependent on epistemological justifications"* [-@hughes1990, 11].

In any science, the relative coherence of its ontological picture paired with its explanatory power is connected to its "maturity". There are predictively and explanatory powerful theories of quantum gravity, autocatalytic cycles and social network dynamics as soon as there are empirically adequate descriptions of entities invoked in these theories[^pragmatic-ontology].

[^pragmatic-ontology]: The question of inference to existence claims from empirical adequacy is a subtle one, and we will cover it in section #insertSource.

A viable ontology is both a product and a project of any science. It is a foil for future research and an ultimate goal of knowing "what there is". Conjectures about the nature of objects of study influence the ways of approaching them: if the social world, for example, is comprised of individuals, you will probably study individuals, their properties and relationships between them. Philosophy and history of science have seen cases when mistaken ontology led to scientific mistakes[^1]. In social science, the issue of ontology is even more complicated due to its multi-paradigm nature and lack of shared foundations: diverse objects of study, methods and explanatory strategies[^2].

<!--The relevance of studying ontology in social science stems from two things:-->
<!---->
<!--- its connection with cumulative growth of knowledge [@lauer2019] which is the main aim of science [@bird2022]-->
<!--- its connection to policy-making and potential usage in social design [@tromp2023; @vink20232], which is said to be detached from social science [@eriksson2010].-->

Having a set of core concepts and a unifying principle like mechanics in physics and evolution by natural selection in biology would propel social science to higher explanatory and predictive power. Although some scholars argue that multi-paradigm nature of social science is a "feature" and not a "bug" as social reality is intrinsically complex and highly contextual [@little2016], it still impedes cumulative growth of knowledge [@genov2019]. As Porpora notes, in terms of Kuhn [-@kuhn2009], sociology is not a mature science, but a pre-science [@porpora2015]. And, as Kuhn suggested, an appropriate activity in such a state is continuing the search for a discipline-wide consensus.

@turner2001 suggested that social science is still at a stage similar to biology before Darwin's theory of evolution. In biology, scientists have studied flora and fauna extensively, understanding their local habitats, predicting natural phenomena like frost damage to buds and soil improvement leading to better growth. This study resulted in the creation of "field guides" documenting this detailed knowledge. While these studies provided rich insights into individual species and their environments (like niche analysis), they did not explain how species originate and change over time. The unifying principle consolidated ontological pictures by explaining the mechanisms of emergence of entities like species. Further research and subsequent evolutionary synthesis enriched ontological picture of biology.

Just as biology relied on evolutionary theory to understand biological processes more broadly and universally, social science is currently using various methodologies to study specific societies, cultures, or other phenomena, but needs a comprehensive explanatory framework to address foundational questions about how these systems emerge and change and what does exist in the social realm. There have been candidates for such a framework, from older ones like structural functionalism  [@parsons1937] and self-referential system theory [@luhmann1995] to newer ones like rational choice theory [@coleman1990; @fararo1989], critical realism [@archer1995; @elder-vass2010], assemblage theory [@delanda2019] and analytical sociology based around the notion of social mechanisms [@hedstrom2005; @demeulenaere2010; @hedstrom2009]. All of them made valuable contributions, but none have become mainstream discipline-wide and, more importantly, outside of sociology.

Along with sociologists, philosophers of social science have been offering definitions of the scope and objects of sociology and broader social science, devising analytical truths about the social domain. Some of them claim that *analytic* social ontology based on conceptual analysis is prior to social scientific methodology [@searle1995; @epstein2016; @lauer2019]. Others criticize this approach as detached from actual science and not "naturalistic" [@elder-vass2007; @sarkia2023; @kincaid2024; @ross2023; @little2020]. Their focus is meta-ontological rather than ontological as they wonder what it means to ask questions about ontology of social science and what are the ways to arrive at an ontology instead of proposing or criticizing particular ontological pictures.

An important yet subtle distinction must be made before proceeding: that of "sociological ontology" and social ontology. The former is the inward-oriented study of the foundations of sociology and is closely connected with empirical and theoretical research within sociology. The works of critical realists [@archer1995; @elder-vass2010; @lawson2019], Giddens [-@giddens1984] and Bourdieu [-@bourdieu1990] exemplify this strand[^implicit]. The latter, social ontology is a science-independent philosophical study of the social entities started in analytic philosophy. It uses the conceptual analysis and tools like set theory, possible worlds semantics, ontological dependence and the like for which sometimes get criticized as detached from science. Although there is no such distinction in the literature, adopting one can clarify the contribution of the current work, which is to sociological ontology.

[^implicit]: Such "sociological ontology" can be found almost in any sociological theory as soon as it implicates ontological commitments.

The remainder of this chapter is structured as follows. In the second section I argue that sociological ontology is the most reliable way of doing social ontology. I do that by defending inference to the best explanation (IBE) as a methodology for doing social ontology. In the third section, I argue that multi-paradigm character of sociology and the alleged lack of widely-accepted foundations is due to the lack of ontological constraints on concepts. There, I review major attempts at unification of sociology and identify key useful notions and a "checklist" for building social ontology.

<br/>

## What it means to talk about 'social ontology'
A good deal of current social ontology is detached from actual social science [@sarkia2023]. It is mostly developed in analytic philosophy [@baker2019; @searle1995; @epstein2015; @gilbert1992] and social scientific strand tradition of critical realism [@archer1995; @elder-vass2010]. There are views that social ontology is intrinsically more complex than any "natural" ontology for being "interactive", or dependent on beliefs of individuals and hence changeable [@hacking1999; @epstein2015] and that social reality is inherently normative which means it cannot be descriptive and hence cannot import methodologies from "natural" ontologies [@asta2024; @haslanger2012] which render and justify the importance of an "extra-scientific" study of the social world. To me, these are two distinct projects: a set of *mutually coherent and explanatory powerful descriptions* of social phenomena and a normative theory thereof.

According to @epstein2018, the field of social ontology divides into two distinct inquiries. The first one deals with the constituents of social entities and addresses the question “what is the social world composed of?”. The second strand of research is concerned with the construction of social categories, or kinds, and with the question “how do social kinds like money, borders, marriage and others get established?”. Individual people constituting a social group exemplify the former inquiry and children playing a game where stuffed animals have a tea party exemplify the latter (as they have "set up" the conditions for something to be a tea party) [@epstein2015, 57].

The difference between strands is in metaphysical relation of individuals to social facts. In the case of individuals and groups, social facts supervene on the facts about individuals, meaning that social properties cannot change without changing the individual ones. In the case of a toy toy party, facts about individuals set up the conditions for something to count as a social fact [-@epstein2015, 58]. One of the most famous expressions of the latter is Searle's [-@searle1995] formula “X counts as Y in context C”. For example, “bills issued by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing (X) count as dollars (Y) in the United States (C)“ [-@searle1995, 28]. Epstein calls the former relationship "grounding" and the latter "anchoring", where grounding is responsible for instantiation conditions for a social fact or category like money, and anchoring is responsible for the mechanism of establishing these conditions. For example, in Searle's case, collective acceptance of the fact X is such a mechanism[^grouding]. 

[^grouding]: The Searle's formula involves both relations, grounding and anchoring, but for the sake of simplicity and to illuminate collective acceptance as a necessary condition for Searle's formula I will refer to it as to anchoring.

Such consideration exemplifies one of the two main views on the role of metaphysics[^metaphysics] in scientific inquiry, specifically in the sociological one. The first, empiricist one, renders metaphysics irrelevant and redundant or, if taken seriously, expects its constraints on models to impede the knowledge growth. The other view presupposes special metaphysical concepts beyond the vocabulary of science itself. For example, they discern grades of possibility and necessity largely unknown to science and go beyond causal dependence widely used in science [@ross2023].

@ross2023 suggests the distinction of *analytic* and *scientific* social ontology, where the former is derived from conceptual analyses and the latter is based on empirical investigations. For Ross, 'naturalistic metaphysics' as he calls it, does not apply transcendental concepts except those featured in theories, models or explanations of "first-order science". Ross defends what he calls 'radically naturalistic metaphysics' which is aimed at promoting scientific progress and might involve unifying or synthesising scientific discoveries.

[^metaphysics]: Metaphysics differ from ontology in that the latter is a focal set of entities in a domain which are said to exist and the former is the study of broader notions of identity, causality and the like.

Physics provides better contrast for comparing scientific and analytic metaphysics. Ontology of physics is formulated in mathematical terms requiring some technical proficiency. Formulating ontology of physics in an analytic way with "possible worlds" and "propositions" would be counterintuitive and unnecessarily difficult. It would require translation of already existing scientific concepts into the language of analytic metaphysics. 

Social science does not enjoy the straightforfardness of mathematical formulations of its concepts[^mathsoc]. Instead, it invites "folk" concepts like "beliefs", "groups" and "social facts" in its ontologies. Further divide comes from the attitude towards this ambiguity. Some scholars argue that such "folk" ontologies are sufficient [@ruben1989, @thomassen2003] and others put an interplay of "folk" and social scientific ontologies to the fore by bridging what @sellars1962 called "manifest" and "scientific" images[^sellars] of phenomena within their social ontological theorizing [@asta2012; @guala2016; @haslanger2018]. The ambiguity between "folk" and scientific social ontology might indeed depend on mathematical apparatus and its underdeveloped character in social science. @ross2023 also notes that ontology construction most probably will require its formulation with mathematical frameworks sensitive to structural modeling (like hierarchical Bayesian inference[^hbi]) and not set theory and similar tools from analytic metaphysics. 

 [^mathsoc]: Although not widely known, there have been such attempts. See @simon1962, @fararo1978 and, most notably, @gintis2007.

[^sellars]: #insertSource

[^hbi]: Hierarchical Bayes is a model with probabilistic parameters (meaning they are uncertain) which allows for hierarchical relations between random variables [#insertSource].

With the distinction of analytic and scientific social metaphysics at hand, let us look at possible way of arriving at social ontology in detail. @hawley2018 assesses three possibilities: conceptual analysis, ameliorative (normative) approach and IBE. In terms of Ross, the first two fall into analytic approach and the last one falls into scientific approach to social metaphysics. From Hawley's point of view, only the first two are potent. From my point of view, only the last one. Let us unpack and assess the possibilities.

<br>

### Conceptual analysis and the “Standard model of social ontology”
The method of conceptual analysis involves using logic and intuition to dissect concepts to arrive at necessary truths about the world. Practitioners of this approach start with a priori theorizing, taking concepts they view as important and breaking them into parts. For example, a prominent exampe of this in social ontology is Searle [-@searle1995] who asks whether it is possible to be epistemologically objective about ontologically subjective issues. How can we know the truths about things whose existence depends on our representations or feelings, for example, about money, property and marriage? By analysing these distinctions of ontology/epistemology and objectivity/subjectivity, Searle arrives at an idea of a missing ingredient that allows for an picture of ontologically subjective entities, which is constitutive rules of the form “X counts as Y in C” as in "bills issued by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing (X) count as dollars (Y) in the United States (C)" [-@searle1995, 28]. 

@guala2007 calls the approach to social ontology that uses conceptual analysis the “Standard model of social ontology”. This "model" describes the loosely constrained individualistic foundations of social phenomena and has three key elements: reflexivity, performativity and collective intentionality, as described by @tuomela2002. According to Guala, most philosophers endorsing the “Standard model“ subscribe under all three elements. Reflexivity is a property of social entities to be largely comprised of beliefs about beliefs. There are I-mode and we-mode formulations of reflexive beliefs. Some philosophers say that initial and most basic beliefs comprising “the fabric“ of the social are essentially in We-mode and are not reducible to I-mode [@tuomela2002; @gilbert1992; @schmid2023]. However, there are also more individualistic accounts of reflexive beliefs based on game theory [@guala2016; @bicchieri2005]. Performativity amounts to social entities needing to be continuously maintained,  performed or recreated. Collective intentionality, in its turn, is joint directedness of multiple individuals towards a phenomenon that contributes to its constitution. Collective intentionality tends to be presented either as a derivative of common knowledge and I-beliefs of the form “everyone knows that everyone knows that P“, where P is some social fact like social norm [@bicchieri2005], or as a primitive notion which makes common knowledge redundant. Moreover, there are attempts to naturalize collective intentionality by showing its irreducibility to individual intentionality [@rakoczy2007; @gallotti2012]. 

Concepts can be arbitrary and not reflect the structure of the world. However, concepts like Gilbert's “joint commitment” [-@gilbert1992] or Tuomela's “we-intention” [-@tuomela2002] are not completely arbitrary, as Hawley notes, for they reflect *intuitive notions of the social world*. Having access to intuition makes conceptual analysis, according to Hawley, rather virtuous in the context of philosophy of social science than in philosophy of natural sciences, for mind-dependent social world is presumably more epistemically translucent to its inhabitants than mind-independent matter. 

To illustrate this point, Hawley uses Hacking's distinction of interactive and indifferent kinds, where the former are involved in reflexive loops with beliefs and the latter are not [@hacking1999]. Our classifications of the social world help establish and maintain it, whereas non-social objects are indifferent to our classifications of it. Nature's objects do not change their behaviour given these classifications of them as opposed to social objects. This idea illustrates the notions of reflexivity and performativity characteristic for the “Standard model”. If social entities are comprised of beliefs about beliefs, their nature depends on these beliefs, and if beliefs change, social entities change accordingly. If social entities depend on beliefs about them, it is needed to constantly perform those to maintain them. To do this, it is needed that individuals have collective intentionality about these beliefs. For example, for money to be itself, it is needed for a relevant community to hold a collective intention to believe that certain physical entities can be used as a medium of exchange. 

The three interconnected notions—reflexivity, performativity and collective intentionality—together with a method for arriving at them—conceptual analysis—presuppose that one cannot be mistaken about the nature of social entities, for they are posited a priori and based on intuitive concepts. Hence, if epistemic access is limited and truths are infallible, conceptual analysis cannot lead to viable social ontology *only by itself*. As Hawley sums up, conceptual analysis is still a useful methodology when used with caution, but it cannot securely lead to genuinely naturalistic social ontology and must be suppemented with empirical investifations.

I see the argument about relative translucency of the social world based on intuition unsatisfying and argue that social ontology cannot operate solely on the basis of conceptual analysis. I follow Kincaid [@kincaid2021; @kincaid2024], @ross2023 and @churchland2019 in that ontological claims based on conceptual analysis mistake the properties of the world for properties of the *word*. 

@kincaid2021 argues that current social ontology often builds on unfruitful analytic metaphysics, which ignores major 20th century philosophical results like the idea that science-independent knowledge solely by conceptual a priori analysis is problematic [@quine1960]. Social ontology follows this trend, rarely using real social science research. Conceptual analysis, Kincaid maintains, can indeed clarify concepts, but cannot replace empirical knowledge of the social world. More broadly, he suggests that traditional projects of conceptual analysis testing necessary and sufficient conditions against intuitions will not tell us much about the sciences we want to understand as philosophy does not first decide what is ontologically real or essential before science begins because it is a scientific question itself [@kincaid2014]. 

@churchland2019 goes even further and, drawing on @quine1960, indicates that conceptual analysis as a methodology for making ontological claims is insufficient, for a concept reflects current beliefs and fallaciously mistakes their features for the features of the world. Churchland argues that a *concept's applicability to real-world phenomena depends on science and discovering facts*. What is even more disturbing, she adds that often conceptual analysis yields not a reflection of a concept's meaning but a camouflaged theory with ontological claims about some phenomenon. For instance, a theory that beliefs are semantic and require language [@schooler2014] which has emerged with help of conceptual analysis and no empirical evidence.

Ultimately, conceptual analysis and foundational metaphysical projects that try to "ground" social science in analytical truths [@epstein2015; @epstein2016] might be useful to clarify concepts, but are non-starters for the task of identifying a theoretical core of sociology. 

<br> 
 
### Ameliorative approach
The second methodological approach to social ontology which Hawley reviews is an ameliorative one by @haslanger2012. Haslanger distinguishes between conceptual, descriptive and ameliorative approach to analysis of social categories like “race”, “gender” and others that can be extended to institutional categories like “marriage”, “borders” and others, as well. She makes another distinction between manifest and operative concepts, where the former is a theory individuals use to make sense of the term and the latter is a practice associated with it, what do people actually mean when they invoke a concept in the "wild".

In Haslanger's view, conceptual approach sheds light on “our” manifest concept of, say, “marriage” by inquiring into what do “we” take it to be. It might show how different understandings of the term “marriage” changed over time and across social structure. Descriptive approach circumscribes the operative concept of “marriage” by explicating, where possible, natural (chemical, biological, neurological) constraints on paradigm cases of the term studied. Lastly, ameliorative approach defines “our” purposes regarding the term and elucidates what concept would fulfill this purpose. An important addition is that in the last case “normative input” is required. The implication of this approach to social concepts is that if one has a descriptively accurate theory but does not like its normative outcomes, she is entitled to discourage it. 

As Guala notes, Haslanger wants to put forward the idea that morally unacceptable institutions can and should be reformed [-@guala2016b, 188]. However, as he notes, this position is in tension with realism, for the latter presupposes that reference of a category is determined by the world and not by “us”, which falls under Churchland's criticism of a concept reflecting current belief and not a feature of the world. Ameliorative approach might be said to be a flavour of the "Standard model" as it shares the idea of reflexivity, or dependence of social ontology on beliefs of individuals. A shortcoming of this approach is reducing ontology to politics, which means that one should discuss and converge on “our” legitimate purposes regarding a studied term, which might not be self-evident thing to do. 

Ameliorative approach does not allow fallibilism which means you cannot mistake about the structure of the social world, for communal consensus is the criterion for a concept's applicability and ontological verification. However, if one can be mistaken about operative and manifest concepts of a social category, she cannot be mistaken about its normative input as she defines it. And since normativity is explanatory essential to ameliorative approach, it is not realist and cannot help identify a theoretical core of sociology.

<br>

### Inference to the best explanation
The final strategy discussed by Hawley is inferring social ontology from the best social science. It takes mature and predictively successful theories to be an approximation to what there really is. This position is known as scientific realism [@psillos1999]. Semantically, it takes scientific theories to be truth-conditioned descriptions of the structure of the world, meaning that they might be either true or false, and metaphysically it views the world as mind-independent and clustered into natural kinds[^9]. The semantic position of scientific realism implies fallibilism, for one's theory might be mistaken about the world's structure. 

Hawley criticises this strategy, for, as she points out, there is still massive divergence in social scientific paradigms, from rational choice [#insertSource] to hermeneutics and *Verstehen* [#insertSource]. According to Hawley, social science is not mature enough and does not have an agreed theoretical core which can generate plausible predictions. The predictive capacity, along with maturity of science, is a prerequisite for inference from scientific theory to ontology, as argued by @psillos1999, to whom the author refers. In Hawley's words, “there are no social analogues of the gravitational waves or Higgs boson which bring physics to the headlines“ [-@hawley2018, 191]. For the reasons of immaturity and the lack of shared foundations in social science, she discards inference to the best explanation (IBE) as a methodology for arriving at social ontology.
 
The problem with Hawley's position is that there would be no gravitational waves or Higgs bosons discovered without IBE in the first place. Of course, these discoveries did not bear massive ontological commitments and, hence, did not make any metaphysical claims. But it is further unification that allowed them to be put into a more coherent picture that philosophers can use to infer ontology from. In other words, IBE requires induction and empirical investigations in the first place to arrive at a predictively successful and "mature" science. This goes in hand with Ross's suggestions of 'radically naturalist metaphysics' which consists solely of first-order science and uses induction [@ross2023].

@saunders2020 counters Hawley's arguments with a case study from social epidemiology, namely income inequality hypothesis which enjoys predictive success and hence could inform ontology. Saunders critiques Hawley's reliance on Kuhnian paradigms, suggesting that the sociological mechanisms influencing scientific consensus may not necessarily track truth. This critique highlights the complexity of establishing what constitutes a mature theory in the social sciences.

 @scholz2018 also critiques Hawley's position and advocates for an inductive approach to metaphysics, emphasizing the importance of a posteriori sources of justification and inductive methods. This approach is rooted in the idea that metaphysical theories should evolve through empirical testing and reflection, rather than solely through abstract reasoning. Scholz highlights the necessity of making empirical assumptions explicit and testing them through inductive and abductive methods. While metaphysicians rely on concepts derived from intuitions, like social ontologies of @searle1995, @gilbert1992 and @tuomela2002 which Scholz mentions, they still may depend on hidden empirical assumptions that could be fallible. Hence, it is more safe to explicate and empirically check them before postulating any 'pre-scientific', or analytical, ontology.

@guala2016 emphasizes the close connection between ontology and explanation in case of using IBE:

> Our best guide to ontology is provided by our best scientific theories. According to the widely accepted method of inference to the best explanation, we can infer what exists from the theories that best explain our observations. In light of this, we believe that those doing ontology cannot avoid being concerned with explanation. [@guala2015, 478]

<br>

How is IBE applicable to social ontology? The inductive strategy displays a directed relation between social ontology and social science—from the latter to the former. However, there is a controversy over which is primary. Drawing on @epstein2015, @lohse2017 and @searle2008, @lauer2019 reviews and critically assesses the argument that social ontology is prior to social scientific methodology, for it can promote success in prediction and explanation by providing a correct view of the social reality. For example, Searle notes that social ontology is prior to methodology and theory: “It is prior in the sense that unless you have a clear conception of the nature of the phenomena you are investigating, you are unlikely to develop the right methodology and the right theoretical apparatus for conducting the investigation” [-@searle2008, 443]. Epstein expresses a similar concern: “Ontology has ramifications, and ontological mistakes lead to scientific mistakes. Commitments about the nature of the entities in a science—how they are composed, the entities on which they ontologically depend—are woven into the models of the science” [-@epstein2015, 127]. Ontology affects methodology in the sense of defining relevant aspects of a phenomenon under consideration which influences the way to approach it. However, it is hard to define these aspects a priori. Social ontology is not prior to social methodology, for relevant aspects of phenomena are subject to empirical testing, and this applies to social science, as well.

@little2020 rejects the a priori stance and argues that social ontology cannot be justified on non-empirical grounds. Contra @lauer2019, @epstein2015 and @searle2010, he holds that social ontology is the most abstract edge of social scientific theorizing, and that it is iteratively connected with empirical investigation and theory formation. This stance presupposes similar inductive process as in the natural sciences and in principle supports inference from social science to social ontology. However, Little explicitly rejects the “unity of scientific ontology” implicit in Hawley's reasoning, who presupposes inference from a “theoretical core” of science. The former implies pluralism and case-by-case investigation of social ontology similar to Kincaid's contextualism [@kincaid2021], and the latter implies monism regarding the focal set of entities and relations: there are “main” parts applicable across the board. Little denies the possibility of such a complete social ontology that might serve a foundation for social scientific reasoning and that “cuts the nature at its joints”. As he says, there are no such “joints” in social reality, meaning that there are no “atoms” or fundamental elements of it. Little also denies the idea that there might be a final list of entities from which the social world is composed and in terms of which all familiar social scientific concepts should be reformulated. In other words, Little's realism is much weaker than scientific realism implied by Hawley, and this is why he sees no problem in accommodating realism for social ontology: these are just two different notions of the same title. 

Weak scientific realism like Little's cannot be a robust answer to the "what there is" question regarding the social world, but it can be a starting point if it uses IBE.

Is it possible to be a stronger scientific realist about social world? A helpful distinction here is that of natural and social kinds. Kinds are parts of the world naturally grouped together as opposed to classes which are grouped contingently. @mill1843 connected kinds to scientific inferences and properties. @boyd1991 redefined them as "homeostatic property clusters", for properties are correlated and "packed" together. "Homeostatic" refers to the stability of correlations which have underlying causal mechanisms explaining them. Kinds with such homeostatic properties are real kinds. They support inductive inference and generalisation, and are studied by the sciences. *Real* refers to either independence from representations or being genuine.

 @hacking1999 introduced *interactive* and *indifferent* kinds, where former depend on our classifications of them. @guala2016 notes that although interactive kinds are not real in the Mill-Boyd sense due to the lack of stability and historical contingency, they rather lack necessity than stability, for if described as patterns of strategic interactions in game-theoretic sense, as Guala does, behavioral regularities and equilibria are indeed stable. As I will claim, interactive kinds like social institutions do possess causal necessity in the their structure, but are historically contingent in theory content.

The problem of social ontology hence might be reformulated as "are (some of) social kinds natural ones?" If yes and they indeed possess homeostatic properties independent from individuals' representations of them, they might be candidates for basic ontological units of the social world. It would help to identify conditions for successful IBE, namely, that an ontological unit in question should support inductive inference. 

<!--But the next question is how to identify a real kind? -->

🚧 Another option that explicitly addresses this problem is Guala's [-@guala2016b, ch. 12] proposal that social kinds are not strictly mind-independent as in “proper” scientific realism, but loosely depend on our representations of them. He takes Hacking's idea of reflexive loops and social kinds as interactive kinds seriously and argues that causal dependence of social kinds on representations does not preclude from realism. Causal dependence means that our beliefs about social kinds intervene on their nature. But would not this imply anti-realism and anti-fallibilism about social kinds? No, for Guala's social kinds are not only a product of our beliefs about them as it is in the “Standard model” discussed earlier, but also a product of repeated behavioral regularities captured as equilibria of strategic games. For Guala's approach uses equilibrium arguments, it is also about structure, and, in terms of Kincaid, it addresses the process how conceptual relations emerge via social coordination. However, the next, naturalistic step is to ask what are the causal mechanisms of emergence of conceptual, or institutional, relations and social roles?  

<!--as @baker2019 notes, the relation of constitution is a "vehicle of novelty" as it introduces new kinds of things to ontology.-->


🚧 All mentioned attempts at unification stumble upon one caveat. Their very basic concepts and models, for example DBO [@hedstrom2005] or BPC [@gintis2009a], use 'mentalistic' concepts, as @turner2007 calls it, without caring about their cognitive- [ ]scientific counterparts. He supposes that this might "push social theory to the far periphery of knowledge" and that "there is no escape from the cognitive that is not also an escape from meaningful engagements with the problem of social theory" [-@turner2007, 359]. Turner proposes "sane" constraints on sociological theory that it ought to be physically, computationally and cognitively realistic. Its concepts and explanations must be grounded in physically realizable cognitive entities and be computationally tractable.


🚧 Regarding the relationship between the social and the cognitive, philosopher of cognitive and social sciences Stephen @turner2018 reviews two models of the social: the “Hobbesian”, or autonomous agent social, and “pervasive” social. More importantly, he emphasizes that ontological positions are implicitly related to the models of cognition one employs, knowingly or not. 

The “Hobbesian”, or autonomous agent social, presupposes that individual agents are rational deliberators. This view is largely seen in game theory. For example, @skyrms2014 uses evolutionary dynamics to show how Hobbesian social contract might have emerged. Although not discussed by Skyrms himself but pointed out by Turner, a position like this, seen from the perspective of the cognitive-social nexus, implies that the cognitive ontologically precedes and grounds the social. First there are fully formed cognitive agents able to deliberate and then their aggregate “produces” the social. This account leads to individualism stating that explanations of social phenomena should be put forward mostly in terms of individual agents and their actions or that only these exist. 

Turner connects the “Hobbesian” model with the computational model of mind, where it is seen as an internal abstract process of calculation over representations. This means that deliberation is guaranteed by cognitive agents' ability to represent the world and calculate over these representations. This, in turn, has further implications regarding human cognitive architecture and more fundamental question like “is the mind modular?”, “if it is modular, have these modules evolved for serving specific task?”, and the like [@turner2018].  

In contrast, “pervasive” model of the social presupposes that the cognitive and the social are interdependent and affect each other in terms of evolutionary formed cognitive capacities serving certain needs. This means that agents, whose arrangements produce “the social”, are not fully autonomous, for they are themselves byproducts of the evolutionary formed social cognition and enculturation. This position is ontologically ambiguous, for it is not evident what are social entities here. This position might equally lead to holism, which states that social phenomena either exist over and above individuals or should be explained as independent of individualist explanations [@zahle2014] or to individualism. And if this “pervasive” model of the social might seem more empirically plausible from a naturalistic point of view according to recent research [@tomasello2014; @sterelny2012Book], what implications does it have for social ontology? These are open questions.

However, the more fundamental question is “are these models a dichotomy?”, for if not, it would mean that one does not have to choose a “right” model of the social and to subscribe to a correspondingly “right” model of cognition. I argue they are not — the relationship between “Hobbesian” and “pervasive” socials is not a dichotomy, but metaphysical grounding, where the former is ontologically dependent on the latter. It means that in order for a “Hobbesian” social to exist, there should be “pervasive” one in the first place.  

As Turner (2018) notes, coordination is the main mechanism of scaling up from autonomous agents to larger social groups and societies, which means that it is the main mechanism of the “Hobbesian” social. This is essentially what evolutionary game theory studies regarding social ontology. However, as @skyrms2010 illustrates using Lewis's [-@lewis2008] signaling games framework, coordination might have evolved from random signals which are not paired and attuned to each other to produce a coherent coordinated output. In addition, as Skyrms shows that ability to coordinate actions to produce a jointly optimal output is found even in animals, the cognitive requirements for the “Hobbesian” model might be significantly lowered. It means that to be capable of jointly coordinating to come to a social contract does not require ability for rational deliberation. However, this is exactly the part of Skyrms's model that is criticized for its inability to account for another parameters besides signals, i.e. metarepresentation, reading environmental cues like animals' tracks [@sterelny2017]. In other words, it is implausible from the point of view of human evolutionary history. 

The issue with the “Hobbesian” model is twofold: its possibility conditions and its applicability to human social contracts. Taking into account Sterelny's critiques, it seems that cognitive requirements for animal and human coordination are different, for only humans have social institutions. He explains it with a human ability to decouple behavior from stimuli with the aid of representation of the environment [@sterelny2003]. It means that in terms of Skyrms, this is not only externalist random signals which are responsible for the eventual possibility of successful coordination, but representations of these signals as well, which are not accounted for in Skyrms's model. This happens to support Turner's insight on connection between computationalism and “Hobbesian” social.    

However, Sterelny's conjecture is not the only possible one out there. As @paternotte2014 notes, the issue with social evolution theories as a source for naturalistic social ontology consists in showing, why a certain cognitive factor was not only selected for in the first place, but remained robust in the course of evolutionary history. He lists three research strands possible for adopting as a source for coordination as the basis of social ontology. These are Machiavellian intelligence hypothesis stating that strategic abilities like deception, coalition formation and lie evolved, also entailing the capacity for beliefs about beliefs or metarepresentation; the shared intention hypothesis, that recognizes we-intentionality and ability for joint attention and sharing as basic for uniquely human sociality [@tomasello2010]; assisted learning hypothesis, that puts repeated cooperative challenges and adaptations to it as basic for human sociality [@sterelny2012Book]. 

In sum, human ability to efficiently coordinate to produce jointly optimal social outcomes has evolved gradually, and this process was different for human species as opposed to non-human animals. This means that “pervasive” social is primary, and “Hobbesian” is secondary, at least from an evolutionary point of view. Sterelny expresses this shift in game-theoretic terms like a shift from fitness maximization to utility maximization, and explains it with the rapid growth of social groups in early Holocene and accompanying weakening of vertical cultural heritability. This is why “Hobbesian” social is grounded in “pervasive” one.

## Deepseek
The Law of Increasing Functional Information (proposed by Michaelian and others) posits that systems, particularly evolving systems, tend to accumulate functional information over time. Functional information refers to the information that contributes to the system's ability to perform specific functions or achieve goals. This law is often applied to biological evolution, where organisms evolve increasingly complex and functional traits.

Connection to the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and Social Agents:
Functional Information as a Measure of Adaptive Success: Under the FEP, functional information can be understood as the information that enables agents to minimize free energy more effectively. As agents evolve, they accumulate information (e.g., better predictive models, more efficient signaling strategies) that enhances their ability to navigate their environment and interact with others.

Increasing Complexity and Specialization: The FEP predicts that agents will develop increasingly sophisticated models and strategies to reduce uncertainty and surprise. This aligns with the Law of Increasing Functional Information, as agents evolve more complex and specialized ways of minimizing free energy (e.g., through social coordination, communication, and cultural transmission).

Evolution of Signaling and Social Structures: In the context of signaling games and social agents, functional information can be seen in the development of reliable communication systems, shared norms, and cooperative strategies. These innovations increase the functional information available to the group, enabling more efficient collective free energy minimization.

In summary, the FEP provides a mechanistic explanation for the Law of Increasing Functional Information: agents evolve to accumulate functional information because it enables them to minimize free energy more effectively, leading to greater adaptive success.

## Perplexity
### Ontological Levels of Signaling and Behavioral Conventions

Firstly, the concept of ontological levels is important in understanding the structure and function of different aspects within a system or ecosystem. In this context, "signaling" refers to methods used for communication between individuals (or agents), while "behavioral conventions" describe patterns of behavior that are accepted as standard practice.

When referring to these elements as heontological levels, it suggests that they possess certain properties and roles within the overall structure and can be further analyzed or modeled. 

### Signaling Conventions Through Active Output Models

The text notes that signaling conventions (also known as public representations) can be described using generative models of active output. This means we are looking at how signals are generated, transmitted, and interpreted by different agents in a system.

**Generative Models**: These models are predictive and explanatory—they help us understand not just what happens but also why certain behaviors or communications arise in the first place. By understanding these models, one can begin to predict future interactions based on current conventions.

### The Role of Active Output in Generative Modeling

Active output refers to active participation by individuals in generating or influencing social dynamics through their actions and outputs (such as verbal communication, body language, etc.). This type of model is crucial because it allows for a more nuanced understanding of how agents interact within the system.

**Functional Information Law**: The term "functional information" law, associated with this context, likely refers to principles governing how new functional units or behaviors emerge through interactions. It suggests that as different agents engage in active output modeling (i.e., they actively participate and influence each other’s communications), these elements collectively contribute to the overall system dynamics.

**Co-Evolution**: The text mentions "co-evolution" with behavioral conventions and cognitive artifacts. This implies that not only do signaling conventions themselves evolve, but so too do their interactions with existing behavioral norms and internal cognitive structures within agents.

### Formation of Social Agents

Given these mechanisms in place—through generative models of active output, functional information principles, and co-evolutionary dynamics—the text posits the formation of social agents. These are entities that can be considered as having the capacity to make decisions and produce societal effects directly or indirectly through their actions.

### Production of Social Effects

These newly formed social agents, once they exist within this generative model framework, have the capability not only to interact with other elements but also to produce observable social outcomes (i.e., "social effects"). These effects can be positive, negative, or neutral depending on how these agents engage and adapt over time.

### References

The text references several key works in the field of signaling, behavioral conventions, and cognitive modeling:

- **Craver, C. F. (2019)**: His work likely deals with understanding mechanisms at play within complex systems like those involving signal processing.

- **Seitz, A. R. (2020)**: This reference might be pertinent for understanding the principles governing functional information and its role in social agent development.

- **Epstein, J. M. (2012)**: Epstein's work could illuminate the practical application of these theoretical models through real-world or computational scenarios that demonstrate how signaling and behavioral conventions lead to coherent social behavior.

### Summary

In summary, this passage synthesizes various components of social interaction within a complex system. It outlines the necessity for generative models of active output in understanding signaling conventions, highlights the importance of principles like functional information and co-evolution, and concludes by suggesting that as these elements evolve, they give rise to new forms of social agents capable of producing observable effects in their environment.

Если сигнальные и поведенческие конвенции — подлежащие онтологиеские уровни (про уровни и механизмы @craver2019, нужно отдельно написать), сигнальные конвенции (ака публичные репрезентации) можно описать через порождающие модели активного вывода, котрые, вкупе с «законом увеличения функциональной информации» и ко-эволюцией с поведенческими конвенциями и когнитивными артифактами [@seitz2020] приводят к формированию уровня социального агента, принимающего решения [@evans2017]. А такие агенты уже способны производить социальные эффекты [@epstein2012].

## Reduction of paradigms to concepts
Paradigms in sociology differ in objects of study, concepts, methods and explanations [@fig1] Making a decision for each of these components largely defines a theoretical approach. But even reducing them to core concepts, they still can have distinct referents in the world. For instance, @genov2019 proposes the notion of "social interaction" as a candidate for the central concept of sociological theory and lists at least four candidate paradigms: Mead's symbolic interaction, Homans' interaction as exchange, Parsons' interaction as social function latency and Wallerstein's interaction of world systems. 

We can try to find a common denominator in paradigms, a main concept or a set thereof. But is neither necessary, nor sufficient for finding unified theoretical grounds.

## Unification attempts and conditions for it
There have been several attempts at unification of sociology on different grounds: 
    - rational chioce theory [@fararo1989, @coleman1990]
    - communication and self-reference [@luhmann1995], 
    - behavioral sciences including sociology, anthropology, political science and economy [@gintis2007, @gintis2013, @helbing2015]. 
However, none of them made it to the mainstream and became consensual.

***

Any scientific ontology can be either realist or instrumentalist [#insertSource]. The former requires believing that scientific theories are approximately true rather than they are just empirically adequate and correctly describe the observable world, as the instrumentailst stance suggests [#insertSource]. Ontology remains a set of entities in a domain in question regardless of its existence claims. For instance, you do not need to believe that "symbolic social interaction" is an approximation to truth to study it, but you do need to believe in its relevance for acquiring new knowledge about social reality. 

***

To get a more objective picture of what there is in the social realm, natural constraints are needed. They might provide evolutionary and cognitive grounds for social phenomena and thus constrain them and narrow down possible objects and methods of study. In other words, natural constraints for social ontology might be a measure to test theories against. There is an array of work in similar directions [@sperber; @turner2018; @kaidesoja2019]. However, these authors focus on the proximate question—how social phenomena might be related to cognitive ones—instead of an ultimate one—how evolution might have shaped human species to establish unique forms of sociality that are supposed to be a subject of a separate discipline, social science. Let us start with the notion of social ontology and proceed to its natural constraints.

According to @epstein2018, social ontology divides into two distinct inquiries. The first one deals with the constituents of social entities and addresses the question “what is the social world composed of?”. The second strand of research is concerned with the construction of social categories, or kinds, and with the question “how do social kinds like money, borders, marriage and others get established?”. Individual people constituting a social group exemplify the former inquiry and children playing a game where stuffed animals have a tea party exemplify the latter [@epstein2015, 57].

The difference between the strands is in the metaphysical relation of individuals and social facts. In the first case, social facts supervene on the facts about individuals, meaning that social properties cannot change without changing the individual ones. In the second case, facts about individuals set up the conditions for something to count as a social fact, i. e. dollar bills with a particular ink and paper and collective acceptance for money. [-@epstein2015, 58].

One of the most famous expressions of the latter is Searle's [-@searle1995] formula “X counts as Y in context C”. For example, "bills issued by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing (X) count as dollars (Y) in the United States (C)" [-@searle1995, 28]. Epstein calls the former relationship grounding and the latter anchoring, where grounding is responsible for instantiation conditions for being, say, money, in a particular context, and anchoring for the mechanism of how these conditions have been established. For example, in Searle's case, collective acceptance of the fact X is such a mechanism.[^3]

What makes social ontology "naturalistic" in terms of grounds and anchors? I take it to be naturalism about anchors, or a mechanism of bringing about instantiation conditions of a social entity. On this account, social ontology addresses natural constraints of, and their influence on, social phenomena, namely, the role of representations, mental states, their physical realization and evolution.

***

After all, what is naturalistic social ontology and how particularly to arrive at it using inductive strategy in a weaker, Little's “iterative process” form? I take naturalistic social ontology to be a scientifically realist position addressing mind-dependence of social kinds causally, not just by postulating beliefs, representations, or propositions but by studying evolved physically realized cognitive mechanisms and capacities supporting equilibrium explanations, for latter ones lack any mechanism [@hedstrom2010]. To arrive at such a position, one needs a “theoretical core” to “induce” from.

As Gintis [-@gintis2007; -@gintis2009a; @gintis2013] argues, social and behavioral sciences can be unified on the basis of game theory, which lends itself as this “core”. He argues that game theory is a "universal lexicon of life", for it "permits the precise framing of meaningful empirical assertions, but imposes no particular structure on the predicted behavior" [-@gintis2007, 8]. However, there have been quite massive doubts in such a general applicability of game theory [@guala2006]. In addition, according to @turner2007, social theory requires “sane” constraints: it ought to be physically, computationally and cognitively realistic. It means that its concepts and explanations must be grounded in physically realizable cognitive entities and be computationally tractable. Game theory, in this sense, only covers the computationally tractable aspect. All this implies that such a “core” can be assembled with more attention to naturalistic constraints.

## IBE with naturalistic constraints on social ontology

It seems that inference to the best explanation in regard of social ontology requires more explicit appeal to naturalistic components of such ontology. In particular, ones that address and illuminate the causal structure of mind-dependence of social kinds. But how to account for it?

According to @turner2007, social theory relies heavily on and makes generous use of mentalistic and cognitive concepts like “meaning”, “belief”, “collective representations” and the like, but at the same time it employs the strategy of minimizing the cognitive by using these concepts only metaphorically and not engaging with the actual cognitive science. He “sane” constraints of physical, computational and cognitive realism on social theory means that the concepts and explanations of social science must be grounded in physically realizable cognitive entities and be computationally tractable. He draws on @guala2016 who discusses the possibility of attaining an equilibrium without explicit prior agreement with the help of a physical marker that he calls a “focal point”, sketchily connects domains of joint attention, focal points, correlated equilibria and social coordination and suggests that “*we can think of actual societies as made up of multiple focal points which are the subject of joint attention by different overlapping groups, as the distributed rather than centralized source of multiple modes of coordination*” ([@turner2018, 209]). Thus, he makes preliminary steps towards meeting his own theoretical constraints. These, however, are not elaborated yet, but the direction is seen vividly. And if game-theoretic explanations of coordination might be said to be computationally realistic in their description of attaining and sustaining an equilibrium, i.e. by inductive learning [@vanderschraaf2001], the other two requirements remain unsatisfied.

From another perspective, @sperber2011 proposes a framework for naturalistic and mechanistic social ontology with his approach of epidemiology of representations [-@sperber1996]. It consists of sub-personal social cognitive causal chains that secure the relationship between inputs and outputs. Social phenomena, according to Sperber, are "causal chains of mental events inside people and events in their common environment" [-@sperber2011, 71]. Sperber's ontological proposition is constrained by cognitive events, but it is limited, for as it sees social entities like institutions as hierarchically nested sets of stabilized representations and behaviors, it does not address (1) the mind-dependence of social entities on representations, (2) causal emergence of these representations in the first place and (3) normative force of these representations. Moreover, Sperber's idea about stabilization of representations' contents as the main ontological mechanism and explanatory target of naturalistic social science is quite close to formal naturalistic theories of meaning and representation relying on evolutionary game theory [see @harms2004]. It means that his account is also incomplete and cannot be used as a sole source for sought after "core" to induce social ontology from.

In a helpful discussion, @sarkia2020 propose a framework illuminating the division of labor between cognitive and social scientists studying social phenomena including coordination which is based on mechanistic philosophy of science [@craver2013; @glennan2017]. Its main idea is that mechanisms for phenomena consist of entities “whose activities and interactions are organized so as to be responsible for the phenomenon" [@glennan2017, 17]. Drawing on Bechtel's [-@bechtel2009] exposition of mechanistic explanation in cognitive science, the authors suggest that such explanations might be given by answering four questions:

- (1) what is the phenomenon?
- (2) what entities and processes it consists of?
- (3) what are the interactions of these entities contributing to the phenomenon? (4) what is the environment where the mechanism is situated, and how does it affect its functioning?

The division of labor, the authors argue, is accomplished by answering different sets of Bechtel's questions. Evolutionary anthropologists and developmental psychologists answer the first and the fourth of them by studying the key differences between human and great ape cognitive capacities and development of uniquely human ones in the course of human ontogeny. In their turn, cognitive scientists answer the second and third questions by identifying particular cognitive mechanisms, for instance, entrainment and common object affordances[^7]. In addition, Sarkia and colleagues put forward the idea that social scientists might address further questions outlying those suggested by Bechtel, i.e. complex social networks emergent from social coordination.

In addition, @ignatow2014 suggests that to further develop sociological theory (so that we can induce ontology from it), it is needed to account for the recent developments in both cognitive and computational sciences. To do that, he argues, it is first needed to take a stand in the philosophy of social science debates regarding ontology. He proposes that an ontology of cognitive sociology to be both realist and constructionist, for experimental methods like magnetic resonance imaging reveal real phenomena which are used to explain how individuals interpret and navigate the social world. The ontological and epistemological stances of cognitive sociology, according to Ignatow, are compatible with various versions of philosophical realism, in particular, Elder-Vass's “realist constructionism” [@elder-vass2007] and Kajdesoja's “naturalized” critical realism without metaphysics [@kaidesoja2013b].

In a similar vein, discussing the integration of cognitive and social sciences, @kaidesoja2019, following @sun2012a and @bloch2012, suggest that cognitive explanations ground and constrain social ones. It means that cognitive explanations are more ontologically fundamental, and that social explanations partly depend on the cognitive ones and are supervening on them. They call this approach “bottom-up” for its attention to causal mechanisms that underlie and enable specific phenomena. At the same time, they criticize Gintis's approach to integration via game-theoretic unification [@gintis2007; @gintis2009a] for its inability to account for causal mechanisms and for heavy reliance on a rational actor model, which implies “economics imperialism” [@maki2009], which is roughly an over-use of the rational actor model. Gintis's main theoretical claim in this context is that the rational actor model and game theory, when modified to take into account the evolved nature of human psychology and the sociocultural theory of norms seen through the lens of game theory, provide a unified modeling framework for behavioral sciences. Kaidesoja and colleagues call this approach “top-down” for its emphasis on fitting the phenomena studied in behavioral sciences like sociology, psychology, and anthropology within a general theoretical framework of game theory in order to understand them. Regarding the approaches discussed by Kaidesoja and colleagues, both “top-down” and “bottom-up” ones only partially satisfy Turner's constraints.

To satisfy computational, cognitive and physical criteria for a theoretical core of social science to induce ontology from, one needs to address the conceptual limits of game-theory and push it towards evolutionary explanations of cognitive capacities responsible for social cognition. It implies assuming rationality, but it is not limited only to economic one. The notions of “optimality” and “evolutionary rationality” are key in this context [@okasha2012; @okasha2017; @hammerstein2012], for they provide a framework for describing social choice as a phenomenon guided by cognitive optimization which is favored by natural selection. One of the main arguments of evolutionary decision theory is that both the evolutionary process and organisms can be seen “as if” they are rational [@okasha2012; @okasha2018]. This means that phylogenetic characteristics of organisms, including some emitted human and anibehavior,vior are being optimized or approximately optimal. However, this theory does not predict that humans will optimize anything on purpose in the course of everyday life. Instead, it says that evolution puts constraints and favors behavior leading to adaptive ends.

@turner2018 talks about “Verstehen bubble”, which is essentially the Weberian realm of the meaningful and intelligible [@weber1924]. His point is that this “bubble” has biological and cognitive conditions of possibility — mirror neurons are responsible for the very capacity of empathy, which is required to “understand” something [@turner2019]. My position is akin to Turner's in that there is a causal basis for social phenomena rooted in cognition, but it is also different in the sense that I am more interested in the ultimate explanation of the influence of cognition to social phenomena, whereas Turners seems to be more up with a proximal one, for he is interested in how these are connected.

## Conclusion

These have been several considerations to address and incorporate into a more general, naturalistically constrained social theory to induce ontology from, which I lay out in detail elsewhere [@shevchenko2023]. All in all, naturalistic social ontology needs both empirically successful formal game-theoretic models of social coordination and cognitive mechanisms that explain how this coordination is possible. If a naturalist social ontologist starts, like Guala, from the the game-theoretic part that supports realism about observable behavioral strategies at equilibrium, she stumbles upon the need for cognitive mechanisms responsible for it. And if this ontologist starts, like Sperber, from the cognitive part that supports realism about cognitive states and ontological reduction of social phenomena to these states, she arrives at the need for a unifying mechanism, in the light of which the relation between these cognitive states make sense. To sum up, it is possible to arrive at naturalistic social ontology using game theory as “theoretical core” of social science supplemented by its cognitive and evolutionary constraints.

"Structure" here refers to *real patterns* as defined by @dennett1991 and massively elaborated by @ladyman2007. A pattern is considered real if it can be tracked and projected under various physical perspectives, encoding information about structure more efficiently than mere data representation. This makes it useful for predicting the world, aligning closely with scientific practices.

<!--Kincaid defends the thesis that structural realism is already instantiated within the social sciences. He says that the sociological notion of “social structure” presupposing relations between roles and positions instead of individuals and the notion of equilibrium arguments as discussed by @sober1983 are instances of structural relations. However, as Kincaid argues, social structural relations are not causal, but conceptual ones. Roles and institutions are defined in terms of each other. For example, professors are academics who teach at universities, and universities are places where students learn from professors. In this structural realist case mind-independence of social phenomena is not discussed directly, but is acknowledged via the notion of social structural relations as conceptual rather than causal. Another feature of structural realism is its reliance on mathematical descriptions which track real patterns in the world. Adherents of structural realism use them as a criteria for existence of phenomena.-->

<!--[^7]: Entrainment is social motor coordination process, which is temporally synchronous. For example, people applauding in a theatre. Common object affordance is action opportunity of an object. If agents have similar action repertoire, they might engage in spontaneously emerged coordination regarding a certain object. Perception-action matching is a process of matching observed actions and agent's own action repertoire [@knoblich2011].-->

 <!--Ontological theorizing regarding social science can be implicit or explicit. You can find the former inscribed into sociological theories and the latter postulated by philosophers of social science and metaphysicians. For instance, classical sociological theories, from Durkheim to Parsons, presupposed certain ontological commitments by postulating theories' main parts like social facts as the "collective ways of thinking, feeling, and acting that exist outside the individual" which lead to the idea of social phenomena existing independently and irreducible to individuals [@durkheim2014]. Explicit social ontology studies the "nuts and bolts" of the social world and its properties and does not try to explain social phenomena. It "competes" with social scientific methodology for the primacy. Philosophers like Epstein [-@epstein2015] and Searle [-@searle1995, -@searle2010] argue that without *analytically* circumscribing the objects of study in advance it is impossible to arrive at an adequate scientific methodology. Others deny such a priori theorizing and put empirical research first while seeing ontology as theoretical reflection or useful instrumental fiction[^3]. -->

<!--One of the problems of arriving at a non-contradictory theoretical core in sociology is, as I will argue, the *lack of ontological constraints on concepts* which means that concepts are not well-substantiated with empirical data. More broadly, it is a lack of commitment criteria for concepts: when and how do we understand that a concept is substantiated and "is fine". This lack allows for proliferation of objects of study, and, since they are closely tied to possible methods of study, it presumably might have led to the current situation of a multi-paradigm (or pre-paradigm) science. What this lack precisely is, where does it come from, what are the conditions for its resolution and what happens after it, are the points discussed in the remainder of this chapter.-->

<!--## Individualism, holism and "levels": debates within scientific social ontology-->
<!--In philosophy of social science and theoretical sociology alike, there are debates on the ultimately "correct" level of description of social reality. Paradigms and research programs in sociology depart from different levels of description. One of the consequences of this is the well-known problem of micro-macro integration [@mouzelis2005]: how micro-accounts of face-to-face social interactions relate to social institutions, states and world-systems. The problem of the "correct" level of description has been one of the key impediments for the development theoretical core of sociology and inference to ontological claims from it [#insertSource]. Both sociologists and philosophers tried to solve this problem throughout the 20th century, from "Grand theories" as Merton [-@merton1949] has dubbed them [@parsons1937, #insertSource] to recent advancements [@bourdieu, @archer, @giddens, @delanda2019, @elder-vassa, #insertSource]. In philosophy of social science, this problem has been addressed as the debate between individualism and holism and consists of the question over the primary ontological level of description of the social [@zahle2014].-->
<!---->
<!--Notably, the notion of "emergence" has been employed as a remedy for the individualism/holism (or micro/macro) struggle in social ontology and sociology respectively. Although scholars mean different things by 'emergence', the idea of new levels and entities coming into being as a result of interactions of entities on "lower levels" has been used quite widely, from implicit  into @durkheim1995 claims about society as *sui generis* reality to explicit postulation of levels, emergence and even downward causation in critical realism [@elder-vassa, @archer #insertSource] and so-called speculative realism [@delanda2019]. -->

<!--We will not assess every possible option employing "emergence" as a strategy for reconciliation of the micro- and macro-levels. Instead, we will assess the very notion of emergence and conditions in which this term can help circumscribe a viable social ontology. It is a meta-ontological task which is supposed to help identify whether "emergence" can contribute to realist ontology of sociology as a set of core focal entities and mechanisms.-->

<!--The notion of *real patterns* allows for realist special science ontology including sociology [@ross2008b; @ladyman2007].-->
