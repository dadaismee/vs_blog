title: Evolution of social conventions from "animal conventions" with complex signaling
---

# Introduction
What is a convention? As @goodman1989 notes, this term is intricately ambiguous.
* [[@rescorla2019]]

# Chapter 1. Problems of social conventions
The tradition of understanding social coordination as a source of social order is historically rich. It dates back to @hobbes2016 with his idea of social order emerging from rational deliberation of individual agents and resulting into a jointly optimal social decision, an agreement to form a state. According to @epstein2018, a notion of convention was first used as an alternative to "agreement" by Pufendorf [-@pufendorf1673], to refer to language and law. His point was that conventions do not need to be explicitly agreed to and might exist and work without their intentional design. This intuition has largely remained unchanged.

Later, Hume has famously contributed to the advancement of the notion of convention, which is now often referred to and quoted when coordination problems are involved: “Two men who pull at the oars of a boat, do it by an agreement or convention, tho’ they have never given promises to each other”[@hume2003]. Hume offered analyses of many social phenomena like money, property, government, justice and others in terms of convention.

After Hume, philosophers in the Scottish Enlightenment held that social order is an emergent product of individuals' interactions, however, no such order has been specifically intended by individuals. As @ferguson1980 [1767] writes, “nations stumble on establishments which are, indeed, the result of human action, but not the execution of any human design”. In other words, tacit conventions as a fundamental part of the human social world have been discussed long before the rise of game theory, and it became especially convenient to treat conventions using game theory.

Conventions are seen as solutions to coordination problems, a class of problem in game theory, a branch of mathematics dealing with strategic behavior, which require two or more agent to align their actions to produce a jointly optimal outcome. In the next section, we will briefly tour game theory and its main concepts as they will be crucially important in the remainder of the thesis.

## Game theory background
  * game
  * payoff (structure)
  * coordination problem
  * cooperation problem
  * equilibria
	* Nash
	* correlated (Aumann)
	* ESS (Maynard Smith)

- Bicchieri (2001) discusses in depth the problem of belief formation in coordination games. The idea that society is a gigantic coordination game and that social institutions help people find a solution is already in Hume (1748}, but has been reformulated in gametheoretic fashion by philosophers and social scientists like Lewis (1969}, Ullmann-Margalit (1977}, Schotter (1981}, Sugden (1986}, Skyrms (1996, 2004}, Binmore (1998, 2005}. Knight (1992} discusses the coordinating function of institutions, as well as the competitive aspect of games such as battle of the sexes. The puzzle of cooperation in prisoner's dilemma experiments has generated an enormous literature, but explanations based on social norms are quite common-see for instance UllmannMargalit (1977}, Sober and Wilson (1998}, Binmore (2005}, Bicchieri (2006}, Gintis (2009}. Functional explanations have suffered from a bad press in social science as a consequence of Jon Elster's (1983} influential critique. Pettit's (1996} distinction between explanations of emergence and explanations of resilience is meant to resist this critique. On equilibrium explanations, finally, see Sober (1983 — location: []() ^ref-52280
- There are many equilibrium-based theories in the social science literature, stemming from Lewis's (1969} seminal work on conventions. See, for example, Schotter (1981}, Calvert (1998}, Grief (2006}, Binmore (2010}. The account presented here is close in spirit to Aoki's (2001, 2011} and Grief and Kingston's (2011} "hybrid" theories. The use of the hawk-dove game to represent animal and human conflicts over contested resources goes back to Maynard Smith's (1982} work on evolutionary game theory. See also Sugden (1986} and more recently Gintis (2007}. On correlated equilibria see Aumann (1974, 1987}, as well as Vanderschraaf (1995, 1998, 2001} and Gintis (2007, 2009}. The theory of institutions as rules in equilibrium has been discussed in a symposium recently published in the Journal of Institutional Economics. The commentaries of Aoki (2015}, Binmore (2015}, Sugden (2015}, and Smith (2015}, in particular, address some of the issues discussed in this chapter.

## Lewis's "Convention" and its limitations

Lewis wanted to formalize Schelling's notion of "focal point" [[@schelling1980]].
- [SEP](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/convention/)
- [[10.1a1_Conventions-minght-not-be-necessary-for-solution-of-coordination-problems.md]]

The study of convention gained particular momentum with Lewis's seminal book “Convention” [-@lewis2008] which, according to Guala [-@guala2007] was the first attempt to apply rational choice analysis to the domain of social ontology. Lewis saw conventions as solutions to coordination problems in game-theoretic sense. But what are conventions and what relation do they bear to coordination?

According to Lewis, social conventions are behavioral patterns emerging from repeated coordination problems between two or more players. The distinctive feature of conventions is that players conform to these patterns, for they expect others to do so, and it is common knowledge that every player is expected to conform. Deviation from a conventional choice of action leads to lower payoff, so players do not have incentives to deviate unilaterally. As conventions are defined in terms of coordination problems, it is useful to elaborate on them.

Coordination problems are situations where agents have common interests and it is not evident how they can be satisfied. @oconnor2019 distinguishes two classes of coordination problems:

* correlative problems (same choice to coordinate)
* complementary problems (different choices to coordinate)

In correlative coordination problems, agents need to converge on the same choice to coordinate successfully. For example, consider a driving game, where two players drive towards each other and each can choose the left or right side to drive on. If they both are on the same side and no one swerves, they might crash, and if each of them chooses a different side, they will stay safe. One important feature of this and other coordination problems is arbitrariness, meaning that it does not matter on what side both players would converge. Instead, what matters is that they either coordinate by choosing the same action, for example, swerving to the right. On the game matrix, it is represented as two non-unique equilibria. It means that either of them solves the coordination problem.

$$
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
& L & R \\
\hline
L & 1,1 & -1,-1 \\
\hline
R & -1,-1 & 1,1 \\
\hline
\end{array}
$$

Complementary coordination problems, as opposed to correlative ones, require agents to perform different actions, or strategies, to coordinate successfully. As @oconnor2019 points out, division of labor and of resources are examples of this class of games. For instance, two roommates want to organize a party and invite guests. To proceed, they need to tidy up the house and order pizza delivery. If they both do the cleaning, there will be no food when the guests come, and if they both order pizza delivery, they will have plenty of food but be embarrassed by the mess at the house.

$$
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
& O & T \\
\hline
O & -1,-1 & 1,1 \\
\hline
T & 1,1 & -1,-1 \\
\hline
\end{array}
$$

@oconnor2019 draws two important distinctions: between conventions and social norms, and between more and less arbitrary conventions. First distinction means that not all behavioral regularities have normative force. For example, friends have a convention of meeting each Friday evening at a bar, and showing up is not what each of them strictly ought to do, for if someone does not come, it is fine for the rest of the friends. On the contrary, if two cars are driving on the same side of the road towards each other, the drivers are forced to swerve, for otherwise they might crash. They ought to swerve, for not only might one of them be fined but they might cause an accident. To clarify, as @bicchieri2005 points out, conventions are different from social norms in the relationship between self-interest and common interest. They coincide in the former and do not necessarily coincide in the latter. In the case of friends at a bar, there is no or little tension between selfand common interest, while in the case of driving cars there is. O'Connor stresses that conventions and norms are the poles of a continuum along which the former acquire normative force. ^60075e

The second distinction concerns the arbitrary and historically contingent nature of conventions that they “might have been otherwise”. According to Lewis, this arbitrariness is one of the key distinguishing aspects of conventions. However, as @gilbert1992 points out in her critique of Lewis's work, not all possible solutions to a coordination problem are equally profitable for players. In cases where one way of coordinating is more preferred than another, convention will not be that arbitrary. In other words, arbitrariness is a feature of conventions that is a continuum between contingency and necessity. For example, signaling between vervet monkeys might well be modeled as a convention in the Lewisian sense of repeated behavioral patterns of solving coordination problems [cf. @harms2004; @skyrms2010]. However, this convention is not historically contingent in the sense of several possible solutions being equally profitable, for there are evolutionary constraints breaking the symmetry between multiple equilibria. Agents might be hardwired to certain strategies. This distinction, as O'Connor underlines, illuminates some conventions as more functional and others as more conventional.[^4]
