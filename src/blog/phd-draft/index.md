# Introduction
What is a convention? As @goodman1989 notes, this term is intricately ambiguous.
* [[@rescorla2019]]

# Chapter 1. Problems of social conventions
The tradition of understanding social coordination as a source of social order is historically rich. Aristotle grounded social conventions in human nature and the pursuit of *eudaimonia*, or flourishing. He viewed humans as "political animals" who naturally form communities to achieve collective well-being. Justice and virtue, central to his ethics, were seen as the basis for political order. Unlike later followers of the social contract theory, Aristotle saw social organization as intrinsic to human rationality rather than a deliberate agreement [@aristotle1998].

Hobbes reimagined social conventions as constructs invoked by humanity’s violent "state of nature." He argued that self-preservation drives individuals to surrender freedoms to an absolute sovereign via a social contract resulting from explicit *agreement* [@hobbes2016]. Conventions thus arise from fear and rational self-interest, not innate sociability.

According to @epstein2018, a notion of *convention* was first explicitly used as an alternative to agreement by Pufendorf [-@pufendorf1673], to refer to language and law. He synthesized Hobbesian ideas with theological natural law. While agreeing that humans are self-interested, he attributed the "law of sociality" to divine mandate, requiring peaceful coexistence despite innate corruption. For Pufendorf, natural law obligates humans to form civil societies, with God as the ultimate author of social conventions. This introduced a moral dimension absent in Hobbes’s instrumentalist framework, suggesting that conventions are not merely utilitarian but also morally justified. His point was that conventions do not need to be explicitly agreed to and might exist and work without their intentional design. This intuition has remained largely  unchanged.

Hume’s theory of social conventions, articulated most prominently in *A Treatise of Human Nature* [@hume2003] and *An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals* (1751), offers a groundbreaking empiricist account of how social norms and institutions emerge organically from human interaction rather than rational design or divine mandate. Hume’s analysis hinges on three core premises: 

- the role of custom in shaping behavior
- the centrality of mutual benefit in solving coordination problems
- the artificiality of conventions

These are seen as products of collective habit rather than explicit agreement. The components form the scaffolding of his theory, which bridges psychology, ethics, and political philosophy.

Hume’s empiricist framework posits that human understanding arises from sensory impressions and ideas derived from them. This extends to social behavior: conventions emerge not from reason but from repeated experiences that cultivate habits. For instance, Hume’s iconic example of two individuals rowing a boat illustrates how synchronization arises through trial and error, not prior negotiation:

> “Two men who pull at the oars of a boat, do it by an agreement or convention, tho’ they have never given promises to each other”[@hume2003]. 

However, @schliesser2024 stipulates that this kind of coordination is not backed by "Humean conventions" as they, according to Hume himself[^humean-conventions], require "positive social externality", whereas two burglars could effectively row away from a crime scene. We will not focus on this morally-driven notion of conventions.

[^humean-conventions]: As @hume1998 writes, "It has been asserted by some, that justice arises from HUMAN CONVENTIONS, and proceeds from the voluntary choice, consent, or combination of mankind … if by convention be meant a sense of common interest; which sense each man feels in his own breast, which he remarks in his fellows, and which carries him, in concurrence with others, into a general plan or system of actions, which tends to public utility; it must be owned, that, in this sense, justice arises from human conventions. For if it be allowed (what is, indeed, evident) that the particular consequences of a particular act of justice may be hurtful to the public as well as to individuals; it follows, that every man, in embracing that virtue, must have an eye to the whole plan or system, and must expect the concurrence of his fellows in the same conduct and behaviour. Did all his views terminate in the consequences of each act of his own, his benevolence and humanity, as well as his self-love, might often prescribe to him measures of conduct very different from those, which are agreeable to the strict rules of right and justice …". @schliesser2024 notes that positive social externality is a requirement for a purely "Humean" convention.

Over time, repeating patterns solidify into conventions because they resolve practical problems (coordinating labor, establishing property rights) while minimizing friction. Custom, as Hume writes, “renders our experience useful to us” by creating stable expectations about others’ behavior, even in the absence of formal rules [@hume2003] . This emphasis on habit challenges rationalist theories like Hobbes’s by showing how conventions evolve *unconsciously* through iterative adjustments.

Hume identifies conventions as solutions to recurrent coordination problems where multiple potential solutions. His analysis of language, currency, and property rights highlights four key features of conventions:  

- **Mutual benefit**: All parties gain from adhering to the convention (e.g., synchronized rowing ensures progress; standardized currency facilitates trade)
- **Multiple potential solutions**: Different solutions could theoretically work (e.g., rowing fast or slow), but consistency matters more than the specific choice
- **Unplanned agreement**: Conventions develop spontaneously through “a slow progression” of trial and error, not deliberate contract
- **Reciprocity**: Adherence depends on the expectation that others will reciprocate, creating a self-reinforcing cycle of trust.

For Hume, conventions like property rights arise because humans recognize the “common interest” in stabilizing possessions to avoid conflict, even if their natural inclinations lean toward self-interest [@hume1998]. This pragmatic focus distinguishes his theory from moralistic accounts, framing conventions as tools for managing inherent human partiality.

Hume classifies conventions as *artificial virtues*, social constructs developed to counteract humanity’s “limited generosity”. Unlike natural virtues like benevolence, which arise instinctively, conventions like justice or promise-keeping require cultivation. Their artificiality, however, does not make them arbitrary. Instead, they gain normative force through collective sentiment: individuals approve of conventions that promote social utility, and disapproval of violations strengthens adherence over time. This process explains how conventions acquire moral weight, transforming into norms that feel binding even when rational self-interest might suggest defiance. Experimental studies inspired by Hume’s (or rather Lewis's [-@lewis2008]) work confirm that conventions stabilize behavior even when incentives to defect arise, underscoring the interplay of habit and normativity [@guala2010].

Hume’s theory diverges sharply from social contract models. While Hobbes root conventions in deliberate agreements to escape chaos or secure rights, Hume dismisses the notion of a primordial “state of nature” requiring such pacts. Instead, he argues that conventions emerge incrementally from lived experience, reflecting his broader skepticism toward rationalist abstractions. His framework also anticipates modern game theory, particularly David Lewis’s analysis of conventions as coordination equilibria [@lewis2008], though Hume places greater emphasis on psychology.  

Crucially, Hume’s account bridges descriptive and normative domains. By showing how conventions evolve from practical needs to moral norms, he offers a naturalistic explanation for social order that avoids appeals to divine law or metaphysical necessity. This aligns with his rejection of causation as anything beyond observed regularity, reinforcing his view that human institutions are contingent products of custom rather than eternal truths.

After Hume, philosophers in the Scottish Enlightenment held that social order is an emergent product of individuals' interactions, however, no such order has been specifically intended by individuals. As @ferguson1980 writes, “nations stumble on establishments which are, indeed, the result of human action, but not the execution of any human design”. Afterwards, however, the study of conventions has quieten. 

Lewis has revived and operationalized Hume’s insights into a theory of conventions using game theory and treating conventions as Nash equilibria sustained by common knowledge and precedent. While Hume emphasizes historical contingency and gradual emergence, Lewis imposes stricter criteria of rationality and mutual expectations [@lewis2008]. He sees conventions as solutions to coordination problems, a class of problem in game theory, a branch of mathematics dealing with strategic behavior, which require two or more agents to align their actions to produce a jointly optimal outcome. In the next section, we will briefly tour game theory and its main concepts before getting back to Lewis's theory of conventions as game theory will be crucially important in the remainder of the thesis.

## Game theory background
Game theory is a mathematical framework used to analyze situations of strategic interaction between rational decision-makers. Originally developed by John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern in their seminal work *Theory of Games and Economic Behavior* [@morgenstern1944], game theory has since evolved to encompass a wide range of applications in economics, biology, political science, and sociology [@gintis2009; @osborne2004]. It provides the tools to study how individuals or groups make choices when their outcomes depend not only on their own decisions but also on the decisions of others. The fundamental building blocks of game theory are games, players, strategies, payoffs, and equilibria [@zamir2013].

A game in game theory is defined as a formal model $G = (N, S, P)$ where:

- $N$ represents the set of players involved in the game
- $S = (S_1, S_2, \dots, S_n)$ denotes the strategy sets of each player, where $S_i$ is the set of strategies available to player $i$
- $P = (P_1, P_2, \dots, P_n)$ specifies the payoff functions, where $P_i: S \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ gives the utility for player $i$ given the chosen strategy profile [@myerson1991].

A strategy $s_i \in S_i$ is a complete plan of action a player will follow in any situation they might face within the game. Payoffs represent the rewards or utilities that players receive based on the combination of strategies chosen by all involved.

One of the central concepts in game theory is equilibrium, where no player has an incentive to unilaterally change their strategy given the strategies of others. The most well-known equilibrium concept is the Nash equilibrium (NE), introduced by John Nash in the early 1950s [@nash1950]. A strategy profile $(s_1^*, s_2^*, \dots, s_n^*)$ forms a Nash equilibrium if for every player $i$, the following condition holds:

$$
P_i(s_i^*, s_{-i}^*) \geq P_i(s_i, s_{-i}^*) \quad \forall s_i \in S_i.
$$

Here,

- $P_i$ represents the payoff function for player $i$
- $s_i^*$ denotes the strategy chosen by player $i$ at equilibrium
- $s_{-i}^*$ represents the combination of strategies chosen by all other players except player $i$
- The inequality states that player $i$ cannot increase their payoff by unilaterally changing their strategy from $s_i^*$ to any other available strategy $s_i$.

Shortly after Nash’s work, Robert Aumann introduced the concept of *correlated equilibrium* (CE) in 1974 [@aumann1974]. This generalization of Nash equilibrium allows players to coordinate their strategies through signals from a trusted mediator. Unlike Nash equilibrium, where players act independently, correlated equilibrium enables communication or correlation of strategies, capturing coordination through shared information. In a correlated equilibrium, a random signal suggests a strategy to each player, and players follow the recommendation if it is in their best interest to do so. Formally, a correlated equilibrium satisfies:

$$
\sum_{s'_{-i}} q(s_i, s'_{-i}) \cdot [P_i(s_i, s'_{-i}) - P_i(s'_i, s'_{-i})] \geq 0 \quad \forall s_i, s'_i.
$$

Here,

- $q(s_i, s'_{-i})$ represents the probability that the mediator recommends strategy $s_i$ to player $i$ and $s'_{-i}$ to the other players
- $P_i(s_i, s'_{-i})$ is the payoff to player $i$ when they play $s_i$ and the others play $s'_{-i}$
- The inequality ensures that the expected payoff from following the recommendation is at least as great as from deviating.

In the realm of evolutionary biology, John Maynard Smith introduced the concept of *evolutionarily stable strategy* (ESS) in 1973 [@maynard1973]. An ESS is a strategy $s^*$ that is robust against invasion by mutant strategies and satisfies the following condition:

$$
P(s^*, s^*) > P(s', s^*) \quad \text{or} \quad [P(s^*, s^*) = P(s', s^*) \text{ and } P(s^*, s') > P(s', s')].
$$

Here,

- $P(s^*, s^*)$ is the payoff when both the incumbent and the invader use strategy $s^*$.
- $P(s', s^*)$ is the payoff when the invader uses strategy $s'$ while the incumbent sticks to $s^*$.

Beyond Nash, correlated, and ESS equilibria, game theory also explores other equilibrium concepts, including subgame perfect equilibrium, trembling hand perfect equilibrium, and proper equilibrium, among others. These refinements address limitations of the Nash equilibrium, particularly in dynamic and extensive-form games. Notable equilibrium refinements include:

- Subgame Perfect Equilibrium (SPE): Introduced by Reinhard Selten [@selten1965], SPE ensures rational behavior at every stage of a dynamic game by requiring equilibrium strategies in every subgame. It refines Nash equilibrium by eliminating non-credible threats and is particularly relevant in sequential games.

- Trembling Hand Perfect Equilibrium (THPE): Proposed by Selten [@selten1975], THPE accounts for the possibility of small, unintended mistakes (or trembles) by requiring that strategies remain optimal even if there is a slight probability of error. This refinement helps to eliminate equilibria that are not robust to slight deviations.

- Proper Equilibrium: Introduced by Roger Myerson [@myerson1978], this concept strengthens trembling hand equilibrium by further penalizing less likely mistakes. It ensures that less probable errors are assigned proportionally smaller probabilities, reinforcing stability.

- Sequential Equilibrium: Developed by Kreps and Wilson [@kreps1982], this refinement addresses the problem of imperfect information by combining strategies with beliefs about what has happened earlier in the game. It is particularly useful in signaling games and dynamic strategic interactions.

- Perfect Bayesian Equilibrium (PBE): Extending the Bayesian framework, PBE requires that players update their beliefs consistently using Bayes’ rule and choose optimal strategies given their beliefs. It is widely applied in games with incomplete information [@fudenberg1991].

These equilibrium refinements aim to ensure stability and plausibility in strategic settings by accounting for dynamic aspects, imperfect information, and potential errors.

Coordination and cooperation problems are fundamental challenges in game theory, where players must align their actions to achieve mutually beneficial outcomes. 

- Coordination problems arise when individuals or groups need to choose between multiple possible equilibria, creating ambiguity about which solution will be selected. These problems are central to strategic interaction because they reflect situations where all parties would benefit from making compatible choices but may struggle to agree on a single option. 
- Cooperation problems, on the other hand, highlight the conflict between individual rationality and collective benefit, where mutual cooperation yields a better outcome for all, but self-interest may lead to suboptimal results. Such challenges often require mechanisms to facilitate coordination or encourage cooperation, including social conventions or equilibrium selection techniques. Consequently, equilibrium concepts are fundamentally linked to coordination and cooperation problems because they model how rational agents arrive at stable solutions given others' strategies.

Examples of coordination and cooperation problems include classic games like the Battle of the Sexes and the Prisoner's Dilemma. The payoff matrices of these games are shown below[^payoff-matrix].

[^payoff-matrix]: A payoff matrix is a mathematical representation that shows the possible outcomes for each combination of strategies chosen by the players. Achieving coordination often requires stabilizing communication to arrive at mutual agreement, especially when different individuals or groups have conflicting preferences. This need for a reliable mechanism to resolve coordination issues is crucial in many social contexts.

**Prisoner's Dilemma**

These matrices model real-world problems such as social dilemmas and negotiations. For instance, the Battle of the Sexes often represents situations where partners must choose between competing preferences, while the Prisoner's Dilemma models the challenge of mutual cooperation versus self-interest in scenarios like arms races or public goods provision.

- Bicchieri (2001) discusses in depth the problem of belief formation in coordination games. The idea that society is a gigantic coordination game and that social institutions help people find a solution is already in Hume (1748}, but has been reformulated in gametheoretic fashion by philosophers and social scientists like Lewis (1969}, Ullmann-Margalit (1977}, Schotter (1981}, Sugden (1986}, Skyrms (1996, 2004}, Binmore (1998, 2005}. Knight (1992} discusses the coordinating function of institutions, as well as the competitive aspect of games such as battle of the sexes. The puzzle of cooperation in prisoner's dilemma experiments has generated an enormous literature, but explanations based on social norms are quite common-see for instance UllmannMargalit (1977}, Sober and Wilson (1998}, Binmore (2005}, Bicchieri (2006}, Gintis (2009}. Functional explanations have suffered from a bad press in social science as a consequence of Jon Elster's (1983} influential critique. Pettit's (1996} distinction between explanations of emergence and explanations of resilience is meant to resist this critique. On equilibrium explanations, finally, see Sober (1983 — location: []() ^ref-52280
- There are many equilibrium-based theories in the social science literature, stemming from Lewis's (1969} seminal work on conventions. See, for example, Schotter (1981}, Calvert (1998}, Grief (2006}, Binmore (2010}. The account presented here is close in spirit to Aoki's (2001, 2011} and Grief and Kingston's (2011} "hybrid" theories. The use of the hawk-dove game to represent animal and human conflicts over contested resources goes back to Maynard Smith's (1982} work on evolutionary game theory. See also Sugden (1986} and more recently Gintis (2007}. On correlated equilibria see Aumann (1974, 1987}, as well as Vanderschraaf (1995, 1998, 2001} and Gintis (2007, 2009}. The theory of institutions as rules in equilibrium has been discussed in a symposium recently published in the Journal of Institutional Economics. The commentaries of Aoki (2015}, Binmore (2015}, Sugden (2015}, and Smith (2015}, in particular, address some of the issues discussed in this chapter.

There is an intrinsic connection between coordination problems and conventions. Coordination problems often arise when individuals or groups must align their actions to achieve a mutually beneficial outcome. Such situations inherently involve communication and shared understanding, which can stabilize interactions and facilitate coordination. Conventions serve as a mechanism that makes coordination predictable, as they encapsulate mutual expectations that reduce ambiguity. Consequently, conventions can be seen as solutions to coordination problems, providing stable patterns of behavior that emerge and persist within a social context. And an influential treatment of conventions as coordination equilibria was devised by David Lewis [-@lewis2008], whose theory is the topic of the next section.

## Lewis's "Convention" and its limitations
According to Lewis, conventions emerge when repeated coordination games lead to a consistent, self-reinforcing solution. These conventions persist because no one has an incentive to deviate once they are established, mirroring the concept of equilibrium in game theory. Thus, game theory provides a rigorous framework for understanding how social conventions arise and stabilize as solutions to coordination problems.

Lewis wanted to formalize Schelling's notion of "focal point" [[@schelling1980]].
- [SEP](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/convention/)
- [[10.1a1_Conventions-minght-not-be-necessary-for-solution-of-coordination-problems.md]]

The study of convention gained particular momentum with Lewis's seminal book “Convention” [-@lewis2008] which, according to Guala [-@guala2007] was the first attempt to apply rational choice analysis to the domain of social ontology. Lewis saw conventions as solutions to coordination problems in game-theoretic sense. But what are conventions and what relation do they bear to coordination?

According to Lewis, social conventions are behavioral patterns emerging from repeated coordination problems between two or more players. The distinctive feature of conventions is that players conform to these patterns, for they expect others to do so, and it is common knowledge that every player is expected to conform. Deviation from a conventional choice of action leads to lower payoff, so players do not have incentives to deviate unilaterally. As conventions are defined in terms of coordination problems, it is useful to elaborate on them.

Coordination problems are situations where agents have common interests and it is not evident how they can be satisfied. @oconnor2019 distinguishes two classes of coordination problems:

* correlative problems (same choice to coordinate)
* complementary problems (different choices to coordinate)

In correlative coordination problems, agents need to converge on the same choice to coordinate successfully. For example, consider a driving game, where two players drive towards each other and each can choose the left or right side to drive on. If they both are on the same side and no one swerves, they might crash, and if each of them chooses a different side, they will stay safe. One important feature of this and other coordination problems is arbitrariness, meaning that it does not matter on what side both players would converge. Instead, what matters is that they either coordinate by choosing the same action, for example, swerving to the right. On the game matrix, it is represented as two non-unique equilibria. It means that either of them solves the coordination problem.

$$
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
& L & R \\
\hline
L & 1,1 & -1,-1 \\
\hline
R & -1,-1 & 1,1 \\
\hline
\end{array}
$$

Complementary coordination problems, as opposed to correlative ones, require agents to perform different actions, or strategies, to coordinate successfully. As @oconnor2019 points out, division of labor and of resources are examples of this class of games. For instance, two roommates want to organize a party and invite guests. To proceed, they need to tidy up the house and order pizza delivery. If they both do the cleaning, there will be no food when the guests come, and if they both order pizza delivery, they will have plenty of food but be embarrassed by the mess at the house.

$$
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
& O & T \\
\hline
O & -1,-1 & 1,1 \\
\hline
T & 1,1 & -1,-1 \\
\hline
\end{array}
$$

    ***

@oconnor2019 draws two important distinctions: between conventions and social norms, and between more and less arbitrary conventions. First distinction means that not all behavioral regularities have normative force. For example, friends have a convention of meeting each Friday evening at a bar, and showing up is not what each of them strictly ought to do, for if someone does not come, it is fine for the rest of the friends. On the contrary, if two cars are driving on the same side of the road towards each other, the drivers are forced to swerve, for otherwise they might crash. They ought to swerve, for not only might one of them be fined but they might cause an accident. To clarify, as @bicchieri2005 points out, conventions are different from social norms in the relationship between self-interest and common interest. They coincide in the former and do not necessarily coincide in the latter. In the case of friends at a bar, there is no or little tension between selfand common interest, while in the case of driving cars there is. O'Connor stresses that conventions and norms are the poles of a continuum along which the former acquire normative force. ^60075e

The second distinction concerns the arbitrary and historically contingent nature of conventions that they “might have been otherwise”. According to Lewis, this arbitrariness is one of the key distinguishing aspects of conventions. However, as @gilbert1992 points out in her critique of Lewis's work, not all possible solutions to a coordination problem are equally profitable for players. In cases where one way of coordinating is more preferred than another, convention will not be that arbitrary. In other words, arbitrariness is a feature of conventions that is a continuum between contingency and necessity. For example, signaling between vervet monkeys might well be modeled as a convention in the Lewisian sense of repeated behavioral patterns of solving coordination problems [cf. @harms2004; @skyrms2010]. However, this convention is not historically contingent in the sense of several possible solutions being equally profitable, for there are evolutionary constraints breaking the symmetry between multiple equilibria. Agents might be hardwired to certain strategies. This distinction, as O'Connor underlines, illuminates some conventions as more functional and others as more conventional.[^4]
