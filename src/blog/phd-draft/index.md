<!--# Introduction-->
<!--What is a convention? As @goodman1989 notes, this term is intricately ambiguous.-->
<!--Social conventions, the unwritten rules that govern our interactions, present a fundamental puzzle in understanding social order. How do shared patterns of behavior emerge and persist within a population when no explicit agreement dictates them? The term "convention" itself carries a dual meaning, referring both to the ordinary and expected, and to the artificial and optional, highlighting the complexity of this phenomenon 1. Philosophers have long been interested in conventions, recognizing their foundational role in various aspects of social life, including language, law, and morality 1.-->

# Chapter 1. Social conventions: history, definitions and problems
The tradition of understanding social coordination as a source of social order is historically rich. Aristotle grounded social conventions in human nature and the pursuit of *eudaimonia*, or flourishing. He viewed humans as "political animals" who naturally form communities to achieve collective well-being. Justice and virtue, central to his ethics, were seen as the basis for political order. Unlike later followers of the social contract theory, Aristotle saw social organization as intrinsic to human rationality rather than a deliberate agreement [@aristotle1998].

Hobbes reimagined social conventions as constructs invoked by humanity’s violent "state of nature." He argued that self-preservation drives individuals to surrender freedoms to an absolute sovereign via a social contract resulting from explicit *agreement* [@hobbes2016]. Conventions thus arise from fear and rational self-interest, not innate sociability.

According to @epstein2018, a notion of *convention* was first explicitly used as an alternative to agreement by Pufendorf [-@pufendorf1673], to refer to language and law. He synthesized Hobbesian ideas with theological natural law. While agreeing that humans are self-interested, he attributed the "law of sociality" to divine mandate, requiring peaceful coexistence despite innate corruption. For Pufendorf, natural law obligates humans to form civil societies, with God as the ultimate author of social conventions. This introduced a moral dimension absent in Hobbes’s instrumentalist framework, suggesting that conventions are not merely utilitarian but also morally justified. His point was that conventions do not need to be explicitly agreed to and might exist and work without their intentional design. This intuition has remained largely  unchanged.

Hume’s theory of social conventions, articulated most prominently in *A Treatise of Human Nature* [@hume2003] and *An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals* (1751), offers a groundbreaking empiricist account of how social norms and institutions emerge organically from human interaction rather than rational design or divine mandate. Hume’s analysis hinges on three core premises: 

- the role of custom in shaping behavior
- the centrality of mutual benefit in solving coordination problems
- the artificiality of conventions

These are seen as products of collective habit rather than explicit agreement. The components form the scaffolding of his theory, which bridges psychology, ethics, and political philosophy.

Hume’s empiricist framework posits that human understanding arises from sensory impressions and ideas derived from them. This extends to social behavior: conventions emerge not from reason but from repeated experiences that cultivate habits. For instance, Hume’s iconic example of two individuals rowing a boat illustrates how synchronization arises through trial and error, not prior negotiation:

> “Two men who pull at the oars of a boat, do it by an agreement or convention, tho’ they have never given promises to each other”[@hume2003]. 

However, @schliesser2024 stipulates that this kind of coordination is not backed by "Humean conventions" as they, according to Hume himself[^humean-conventions], require "positive social externality", whereas two burglars could effectively row away from a crime scene. We will not focus on this morally-driven notion of conventions.

[^humean-conventions]: As @hume1998 writes, "It has been asserted by some, that justice arises from HUMAN CONVENTIONS, and proceeds from the voluntary choice, consent, or combination of mankind … if by convention be meant a sense of common interest; which sense each man feels in his own breast, which he remarks in his fellows, and which carries him, in concurrence with others, into a general plan or system of actions, which tends to public utility; it must be owned, that, in this sense, justice arises from human conventions. For if it be allowed (what is, indeed, evident) that the particular consequences of a particular act of justice may be hurtful to the public as well as to individuals; it follows, that every man, in embracing that virtue, must have an eye to the whole plan or system, and must expect the concurrence of his fellows in the same conduct and behaviour. Did all his views terminate in the consequences of each act of his own, his benevolence and humanity, as well as his self-love, might often prescribe to him measures of conduct very different from those, which are agreeable to the strict rules of right and justice …". @schliesser2024 notes that positive social externality is a requirement for a purely "Humean" convention.

Over time, repeating patterns solidify into conventions because they resolve practical problems (coordinating labor, establishing property rights) while minimizing friction. Custom, as Hume writes, “renders our experience useful to us” by creating stable expectations about others’ behavior, even in the absence of formal rules [@hume2003] . This emphasis on habit challenges rationalist theories like Hobbes’s by showing how conventions evolve *unconsciously* through iterative adjustments.

Hume identifies conventions as solutions to recurrent coordination problems where multiple potential solutions. His analysis of language, currency, and property rights highlights four key features of conventions:  

- Mutual benefit: all parties gain from adhering to the convention (e.g., synchronized rowing ensures progress; standardized currency facilitates trade)
- Multiple potential solutions: different solutions could theoretically work (e.g., rowing fast or slow), but consistency matters more than the specific choice
- Unplanned agreement: conventions develop spontaneously through “a slow progression” of trial and error, not deliberate contract
- Reciprocity: adherence depends on the expectation that others will reciprocate, creating a self-reinforcing cycle of trust.

For Hume, conventions like property rights arise because humans recognize the “common interest” in stabilizing possessions to avoid conflict, even if their natural inclinations lean toward self-interest [@hume1998]. This pragmatic focus distinguishes his theory from moralistic accounts, framing conventions as tools for managing inherent human partiality.

Hume classifies conventions as *artificial virtues*, social constructs developed to counteract humanity’s “limited generosity”. Unlike natural virtues like benevolence, which arise instinctively, conventions like justice or promise-keeping require cultivation. Their artificiality, however, does not make them arbitrary. Instead, they gain normative force through collective sentiment: individuals approve of conventions that promote social utility, and disapproval of violations strengthens adherence over time. This process explains how conventions acquire moral weight, transforming into norms that feel binding even when rational self-interest might suggest defiance. Experimental studies inspired by Hume’s (or rather Lewis's [-@lewis2008]) work confirm that conventions stabilize behavior even when incentives to defect arise, underscoring the interplay of habit and normativity [@guala2010].

Hume’s theory diverges sharply from social contract models. While Hobbes root conventions in deliberate agreements to escape chaos or secure rights, Hume dismisses the notion of a primordial “state of nature” requiring such pacts. Instead, he argues that conventions emerge incrementally from lived experience, reflecting his broader skepticism toward rationalist abstractions. His framework also anticipates modern game theory, particularly David Lewis’s analysis of conventions as coordination equilibria [@lewis2008], though Hume places greater emphasis on psychology.  

Crucially, Hume’s account bridges descriptive and normative domains. By showing how conventions evolve from practical needs to moral norms, he offers a naturalistic explanation for social order that avoids appeals to divine law or metaphysical necessity. This aligns with his rejection of causation as anything beyond observed regularity, reinforcing his view that human institutions are contingent products of custom rather than eternal truths.

After Hume, philosophers in the Scottish Enlightenment held that social order is an emergent product of individuals' interactions, however, no such order has been specifically intended by individuals. As @ferguson1980 writes, “nations stumble on establishments which are, indeed, the result of human action, but not the execution of any human design”. Afterwards, however, the study of conventions has quieten. 

Lewis has revived and operationalized Hume’s insights into a theory of conventions using game theory and treating conventions as Nash equilibria sustained by common knowledge and precedent. While Hume emphasizes historical contingency and gradual emergence, Lewis imposes stricter criteria of rationality and mutual expectations [@lewis2008]. He sees conventions as solutions to coordination problems, a class of problem in game theory, a branch of mathematics dealing with strategic behavior, which require two or more agents to align their actions to produce a jointly optimal outcome. In the next section, we will briefly tour game theory and its main concepts before getting back to Lewis's theory of conventions as game theory will be crucially important in the remainder of the thesis.

## Game theory background
Game theory is a mathematical framework used to analyze situations of strategic interaction between rational decision-makers. Originally developed by John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern in their seminal work *Theory of Games and Economic Behavior* [@morgenstern1944], game theory has since evolved to encompass a wide range of applications in economics, biology, political science, and sociology [@gintis2009; @osborne2004]. It provides the tools to study how individuals or groups make choices when their outcomes depend not only on their own decisions but also on the decisions of others. The fundamental building blocks of game theory are games, players, strategies, payoffs, and equilibria [@zamir2013].

A game in game theory is defined as a formal model $G = (N, S, P)$ where:

- $N$ represents the set of players involved in the game
- $S = (S_1, S_2, \dots, S_n)$ denotes the strategy sets of each player, where $S_i$ is the set of strategies available to player $i$
- $P = (P_1, P_2, \dots, P_n)$ specifies the payoff functions, where $P_i: S \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ gives the utility for player $i$ given the chosen strategy profile [@myerson1991].

A strategy $s_i \in S_i$ is a complete plan of action a player will follow in any situation they might face within the game. Payoffs represent the rewards or utilities that players receive based on the combination of strategies chosen by all involved.

One of the central concepts in game theory is equilibrium, where no player has an incentive to unilaterally change their strategy given the strategies of others. The most well-known equilibrium concept is the Nash equilibrium (NE), introduced by John Nash in the early 1950s [@nash1950]. A strategy profile $(s_1^*, s_2^*, \dots, s_n^*)$ forms a Nash equilibrium if for every player $i$, the following condition holds:

$$
P_i(s_i^*, s_{-i}^*) \geq P_i(s_i, s_{-i}^*) \quad \forall s_i \in S_i.
$$

Here,

- $P_i$ represents the payoff function for player $i$
- $s_i^*$ denotes the strategy chosen by player $i$ at equilibrium
- $s_{-i}^*$ represents the combination of strategies chosen by all other players except player $i$
- The inequality states that player $i$ cannot increase their payoff by unilaterally changing their strategy from $s_i^*$ to any other available strategy $s_i$.

Shortly after Nash’s work, Robert Aumann introduced the concept of *correlated equilibrium* (CE) in 1974 [@aumann1974]. This generalization of Nash equilibrium allows players to coordinate their strategies through signals from a trusted mediator. Unlike Nash equilibrium, where players act independently, correlated equilibrium enables communication or correlation of strategies, capturing coordination through shared information. In a correlated equilibrium, a random signal suggests a strategy to each player, and players follow the recommendation if it is in their best interest to do so. Formally, a correlated equilibrium satisfies:

$$
\sum_{s'_{-i}} q(s_i, s'_{-i}) \cdot [P_i(s_i, s'_{-i}) - P_i(s'_i, s'_{-i})] \geq 0 \quad \forall s_i, s'_i.
$$

Here,

- $q(s_i, s'_{-i})$ represents the probability that the mediator recommends strategy $s_i$ to player $i$ and $s'_{-i}$ to the other players
- $P_i(s_i, s'_{-i})$ is the payoff to player $i$ when they play $s_i$ and the others play $s'_{-i}$
- The inequality ensures that the expected payoff from following the recommendation is at least as great as from deviating.

In the realm of evolutionary biology, John Maynard Smith introduced the concept of *evolutionarily stable strategy* (ESS) in 1973 [@maynard1973]. An ESS is a strategy $s^*$ that is robust against invasion by mutant strategies and satisfies the following condition:

$$
P(s^*, s^*) > P(s', s^*) \quad \text{or} \quad [P(s^*, s^*) = P(s', s^*) \text{ and } P(s^*, s') > P(s', s')].
$$

Here,

- $P(s^*, s^*)$ is the payoff when both the incumbent and the invader use strategy $s^*$.
- $P(s', s^*)$ is the payoff when the invader uses strategy $s'$ while the incumbent sticks to $s^*$.

Beyond Nash, correlated, and ESS equilibria, game theory explores other equilibrium concepts, including subgame perfect equilibrium, trembling hand perfect equilibrium, and proper equilibrium, among others. These refinements address limitations of the NE, particularly in dynamic and extensive-form games. Notable equilibrium refinements include:

- Subgame Perfect Equilibrium (SPE): introduced by Selten [-@selten1965], SPE ensures rational behavior at every stage of a dynamic game by requiring equilibrium strategies in every subgame. It refines NE by eliminating non-credible threats and is particularly relevant in sequential games.

- Trembling Hand Perfect Equilibrium (THPE): Proposed by Selten [@selten1975], THPE accounts for the possibility of small, unintended mistakes (or trembles) by requiring that strategies remain optimal even if there is a slight probability of error. This refinement helps to eliminate equilibria that are not robust to slight deviations.

- Proper Equilibrium: Introduced by Roger Myerson [@myerson1978], this concept strengthens trembling hand equilibrium by further penalizing less likely mistakes. It ensures that less probable errors are assigned proportionally smaller probabilities, reinforcing stability.

- Sequential Equilibrium: developed by Kreps and Wilson [@kreps1982], this refinement addresses the problem of imperfect information by combining strategies with beliefs about what has happened earlier in the game. It is particularly useful in signaling games and dynamic strategic interactions.

- Perfect Bayesian Equilibrium (PBE): extending the Bayesian framework, PBE requires that players update their beliefs consistently using Bayes’ rule and choose optimal strategies given their beliefs. It is widely applied in games with incomplete information [@fudenberg1991].

These equilibrium refinements aim to ensure stability and plausibility in strategic settings by accounting for dynamic aspects, imperfect information, and potential errors.

Coordination and cooperation problems are fundamental challenges in game theory, where players must align their actions to achieve mutually beneficial outcomes. 

- **Coordination problems** arise when individuals or groups need to choose between multiple possible equilibria, creating ambiguity about which solution will be selected. These problems are central to strategic interaction because they reflect situations where all parties would benefit from making compatible choices but may struggle to agree on a single option. 
- **Cooperation problems**, on the other hand, highlight the conflict between individual rationality and collective benefit, where mutual cooperation yields a better outcome for all, but self-interest may lead to suboptimal results. Such challenges often require mechanisms to facilitate coordination or encourage cooperation, including social conventions or equilibrium selection techniques. Consequently, equilibrium concepts are fundamentally linked to coordination and cooperation problems because they model how rational agents arrive at stable solutions given others' strategies.

Examples of coordination and cooperation problems include classic games like the Battle of the Sexes and the Prisoner's Dilemma. In the former, a husband and a wife coordinate on choosing a leisure activity where everyone is satisfied with the choice, and in the latter, two prisoners independently either defect or cooperate with each other by uncovering her partner in crime to an officer. The payoff matrices of these games are shown below[^payoff-matrix].

[^payoff-matrix]: A payoff matrix is a mathematical representation that shows the possible outcomes for each combination of strategies chosen by the players. Achieving coordination often requires stabilizing communication to arrive at mutual agreement, especially when different individuals or groups have conflicting preferences. This need for a reliable mechanism to resolve coordination issues is crucial in many social contexts.

$$
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
& Football & Ballet\\
\hline
Football & 2,1 & 0,0 \\
\hline
Ballet & 0,0 & 1,2 \\
\hline
\end{array}
$$
**Battle of the Sexes**

$$
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
& Cooperate & Defect \\
\hline
Cooperate & -1,-1 & -3,0 \\
\hline
Defect & 0,-3 & -2,-2 \\
\hline
\end{array}
$$
**Prisoner's Dilemma**

These matrices model real-world problems such as social dilemmas and negotiations. For instance, the Battle of the Sexes often represents situations where partners must choose between competing preferences, while the Prisoner's Dilemma models the challenge of mutual cooperation versus self-interest in scenarios like arms races or public goods provision.

@oconnor2019 distinguishes two classes of coordination problems:

* correlative problems (same choice to coordinate)
* complementary problems (different choices to coordinate)

In correlative coordination problems, agents need to converge on the same choice to coordinate successfully. For example, consider a driving game, where two players drive towards each other and each can choose the left or right side to drive on. If they both are on the same side and no one swerves, they might crash, and if each of them chooses a different side, they will stay safe. One important feature of this and other coordination problems is arbitrariness, meaning that it does not matter on what side both players would converge. Instead, what matters is that they either coordinate by choosing the same action, for example, swerving to the right. On the game matrix, it is represented as two non-unique equilibria. It means that either of them solves the coordination problem.

$$
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
& Swerve left & Swerve right \\
\hline
Swerve left & 1,1 & -1,-1 \\
\hline
Swerve right & -1,-1 & 1,1 \\
\hline
\end{array}
$$

Complementary coordination problems, as opposed to correlative ones, require from agents different actions, or strategies, to coordinate successfully. As @oconnor2019 points out, division of labor or resources is an example of this class of games. For instance, two roommates want to organize a party and invite guests. To proceed, they need to tidy up the house and order pizza delivery. If they both do the cleaning, there will be no food when the guests come, and if they both order pizza delivery, they will have plenty of food but be embarrassed by the mess at the house.

$$
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
& \text{Order pizza} & \text{Tidy room} \\
\hline
\text{Order pizza} & -1,-1 & 1,1 \\
\hline
\text{Tidy room} & 1,1 & -1,-1 \\
\hline
\end{array}
$$

The only difference between the two classes of coordination problems is either choosing same or different actions to coordinate successfully.

Coordination problems and conventions are intrinsically linked as former ones emerge when individuals or groups require aligned action for mutual benefit, necessitating communication and shared understanding to stabilize interactions. *Conventions function as a mechanism for predictable coordination by encapsulating mutual expectations*, thereby reducing ambiguity and establishing stable behavioral patterns within a social context. David Lewis’s theory of conventions as coordination equilibria, explored in the subsequent section, provides a central treatment of this relationship.

## Lewis's "Convention" and its limitations
### Intellectual influences
The intellectual atmosphere in which Lewis’s *Convention* was developed was mostly engaged with questions of language, meaning, and social behavior. Several intellectual movements and concerns shaped the development of his theory.

In the mid-20th century, the interest in influence of social practice on linguistic meaning kept growing, as philosophers like Quine [-@quine1960] and Wittgenstein [-0@wittgenstein] argued that meaning arises from shared use within a community. Wittgenstein highlighted that language's meaning emerges through public usage, rather than inherent semantic properties. For instance, "game" has no fixed definition but derives its meaning from the activities associated with it. Building on this tradition, Lewis sought to explain how linguistic conventions form, stabilize, and persist in communities by providing a systematic account of their development over time. By conceptualizing meaning as coordinated behavior, Lewis laid a foundation for viewing language as a socially orchestrated activity rather than an innate or purely individualistic construct. Consequently, communication relies not on objective meanings but on mutual expectations about usage, emphasizing convention's crucial role in language [@lewis1969].

The Zeitgeist of analytic philosophy in the 1960s grappled with the legacy of Logical Positivism, which, through formal logic and empirical verification, defined meaning based on analytically true statements or verifiable empirical claims [@godfrey-smith2003]. However, by the 1960s, critiques from Quine, Putnam, and others challenged this framework, particularly the distinction of analytic/synthetic truths, the former being true in virtue of their meaning and the latter in virtue of their relationship to the world. 

Quine rejected traditional notions of necessity and analyticity, asserting ontological commitments are embedded within theories and language [@quine1951; @quine1960; @quine1969], emphasizing empirical evidence and pragmatic considerations in shaping beliefs. His critique of analyticity underscored the revisability of language, highlighting conventions as mutable rather than fixed. Putnam’s “Twin Earth” thought experiment further developed these ideas, advocating semantic externalism—the view that word meaning depends on external facts, not solely on mental states—challenging internalist accounts of meaning and emphasizing the role of external factors in linguistic practices. Consequently, conventions are understood as influenced by contextual and environmental factors, moving beyond purely internal or necessary determinations.

[^twin-earth]: On a planet identical to Earth in almost all respects but featuring water composed of XYZ rather than H₂O, inhabitants use the term "water" yet refer to different substance. According to Putnam, this illustrates that psychological states alone do not determine meaning; external factors like chemical composition and environmental acquisition influence linguistic reference. His assertion is encapsulated by his famous statement: "meanings just ain't in the head."

Lewis’s theory of convention was a way to address this intellectual shift by emphasizing the contingent, rather than necessary, nature of meaning and coordination. Rather than being dictated by logical necessity, conventions arise as arbitrary but stable solutions to coordination problems, reflecting a more pragmatic and flexible understanding of linguistic meaning. This perspective is deeply rooted in Quinean ideas about language as being subject to revision, adaptation, and negotiation within a community or culture.

Another major philosophical concern that Lewis addressed was the ontology of social rules and norms, profoundly influenced by Hume's work. Lewis developed Hume's idea of conventions emerging and persisting even in the absence of centralized enforcement. Lewis argued that conventions are self-reinforcing: once established, individuals have no reason to deviate as long as others continue to conform. The major deviation from Hume's thought was accent on rationality of agents as the source of such conformity, whereas Hume emphasized psychological custom. 

An example of this can be seen in the development of money as a medium of exchange. Initially, various objects—such as cattle, shells, or metal coins—served as currency. Over time, paper money became widely accepted, not because of any intrinsic value, but because people expected others to accept it in transactions. This insight was later influential in discussions of spontaneous order and decentralized systems in political philosophy and economics, particularly in the work of Hayek [@hayek1973]. By explaining conventions as natural outcomes of repeated social interactions, Lewis contributed to a broader understanding of how norms, institutions, and linguistic practices can arise organically without explicit design or coercion.

Furthermore, Hume’s skepticism about moral realism, a position stating that objective moral norms exist, played a role in shaping Lewis’s view of conventions as arbitrary yet stable[^alexander]. Hume argued that moral distinctions are not grounded in objective properties but in human sentiment and social conditioning. Similarly, Lewis contends that conventions are not determined by any intrinsic necessity but arise contingently through social practices. For instance, the choice of driving on the right or left side of the road is arbitrary, yet once established, it becomes self-reinforcing because all individuals benefit from adherence to the norm. This reflects Hume’s broader thesis that social order emerges not from absolute principles but from shared expectations and learned behaviors.

[^alexander]: The emergence of objective yet relative moral norms in accordance with Lewisian approach and rigor was developed by @mackenzie2007, which echoes "arbitrary yet stable" notion of instrumental conventions.

If the problems of meaning, language and conventionality served as the issue Lewis wanted to attack and Hume's notion of convention was resource to build upon, Lewis still needed a tool to construct his argument with. He found it in game theory [@vonneumann1944] and, in particular, in Schelling’s approach to strategic interaction in "mixed motive" games. [@schelling1980]. 

Game theory offered a structured mathematical framework for analyzing strategic interactions among individuals conceived as rational actors. Lewis's engagement with game theory and decision theory was facilitated by this prevailing intellectual trend. The emphasis on formal models and rational choice provided a common language and conceptual framework for discussing social behavior across diverse disciplines, making it a natural progression for a philosopher like Lewis to explore these powerful analytical tools in his own work.

Schelling’s work represented a significant departure from prevailing game theory’s emphasis on zero-sum conflict (when there is always a winner and a loser), recognizing that real-world interactions frequently exhibit “mixed motives” or simultaneous conflicting and converging interests. He critiqued the limitations of purely mathematical analysis of strategic interaction and advocated for empirical research to illuminate the conditions shaping behavior, specifically considering opportunities for communication and the presence of attractive alternatives. This expanded scope featuring both conflict and cooperation included the very phenomena of cooperation and coordination that drew Lewis's attention in the context of the problem of social conventions.

Schelling argued that conflict and cooperation are not necessarily opposing forces but are deeply intertwined in strategic interactions. One of his key contributions was the concept of *credible commitment*, where the ability to commit to a particular strategy in advance can influence an opponent’s decisions [@schelling1960, p. 22]. A fundamental aspect of this is *self-binding*, where a player deliberately restricts her own options to strengthen bargaining position.

Another crucial insight was the concept of *focal points* (also known as Schelling points), which are solutions that individuals naturally gravitate toward in coordination games without explicit communication. Schelling demonstrated this through experiments where participants, when asked to choose a meeting place in New York City without coordination, overwhelmingly selected noon at Grand Central Terminal, although it was a location with no inherent payoff advantage but high cultural prominence [@schelling1960, p. 57].

In the study of *pure coordination games*, Schelling examined interactions where players share interests but lack communication, such as selecting matching integers for a reward. Participants often converged on salient choices, such as the number 1, due to its distinctiveness as the smallest positive integer [@schelling1960, p. 102]. His work also refined the Nash equilibrium by demonstrating how focal points can help identify stable and salient outcomes among multiple NE [@lewis1969, p. 78]. Furthermore, for conflict scenarios, he introduced the concept of *"threats that leave something to chance"*, showing that probabilistic threats, such as partial mobilization, can deter adversaries more effectively than deterministic ones by leveraging uncertainty to maintain deterrence [@schelling1960, p. 187].

Lewis formalized Schelling’s insights into a theory of conventions, defining them as solutions to recurrent coordination problems where agents align on focal points due to mutual expectations [@lewis1969, p. 43]. Unlike social norms, conventions rely on extrinsic incentives, such as avoiding coordination failure, rather than intrinsic obligations. Lewis also emphasized that communication itself is a coordination game, where signals, such as Paul Revere’s lanterns, derive meaning from shared conventions [@lewis1969, p. 95].

One of the central ideas Lewis took from Schelling is the concept of focal point, or salience. He showed that social conventions arise as focal points for coordination. For instance, in many societies, people drive on one designated side of the road not because of an inherent preference for that side, but because universal adherence to a single convention ensures safety and predictability. 

Another crucial concept Lewis adopts from Schelling is the role of expectation and self-enforcement in strategic equilibrium. Schelling showed that in many coordination scenarios, once an equilibrium is established, deviation becomes irrational since the costs of uncoordinated action outweigh potential individual gains. Lewis builds on this by defining conventions as self-perpetuating: once a convention is in place, individuals follow it not because of external enforcement, but because mutual expectations make deviation costly. This is evident in linguistic conventions, where the use of certain words and grammatical structures persists because everyone expects others to conform to them.

Furthermore, Lewis’s notion of *common knowledge*, one of the central for his theory of conventions, owes a debt to Schelling’s insights about shared understanding in strategic interaction. While Schelling did not formalize the concept as rigorously as later game theorists, he emphasized the importance of mutual awareness in successful coordination. Lewis developed this idea more systematically, arguing that for a convention to be stable, it must not only be followed but also be recognized as the expected behavior within a group. This refinement allows Lewis to explain how conventions can be maintained across generations and within large populations.

 Furthermore, Lewis’s notion of *common knowledge*, foundational to his theory of conventions, derives from Schelling’s emphasis on mutual awareness within strategic interaction. Though Schelling lacked formalization, he highlighted the crucial role of shared understanding for successful coordination. Lewis expanded upon this, asserting that convention stability necessitates not just adherence, but also recognition as the expected behavior within a group, thereby enabling convention maintenance across generations and large populations.

By drawing on Schelling’s work, Lewis was able to provide a game-theoretic foundation for the study of conventions, demonstrating how they emerge, stabilize, and persist over time. Whereas Schelling’s focus was on strategic choices in conflict and negotiation, Lewis extended these principles to the domain of language, social norms, and epistemic coordination, thus broadening the applicability of game-theoretic insights to philosophy and social science. As a result, Schelling’s *The Strategy of Conflict* remains one of the key intellectual influences behind Lewis’s *Convention* and its enduring impact on theories of social coordination.

### Lewis's theory of conventions
Lewis’s analysis focuses on coordination problems—strategic situations where agents share a common interest in a mutually acceptable outcome, which necessitates matching choices predicated on expectations of others. Such problems involve multiple equilibria achievable through identical or different actions (as in correlative and complementary game classes of @oconnor2019), which demand agents to act solely based on anticipated behavior of others and are characterized by interdependent decision-making between at least two agents with a prevailing coincidence of interest.

Conventions, according to Lewis, solve coordination problems via salient and mutually-beneficial strategic choice options. 

Lewis defines social conventions as an arbitrary yet self-sustaining behavioral pattern emerging from repeated coordination problems between two or more players. Its distinctive feature is players' conformity to these behavioral patterns, for they expect others to do so, and it is *common knowledge* that every player is expected to conform. Deviation from a conventional choice of action leads to lower payoff, so players do not have incentives to deviate unilaterally which is on their own. For example, if everyone drives on the right side of the road, it is rational for each driver to do the same to avoid collisions. Lewis [@lewis1969, p. 76] formulates convention as follows:

A behavioral regularity $R$ within a population $P$ in a repeated situation $S$ qualifies as a convention if and only if:

1. Every member of $P$ conforms to $R$.
2. Each individual expects others to conform to $R$.
3. All members have similar preferences regarding possible behavioral patterns.
4. Each person prefers universal conformity to $R$, provided that nearly everyone else adheres to it.
5. Members would also prefer an alternative regularity $R'$ under the same conditions, as long as $R'$ and $R$ are mutually exclusive.

Lewis later refines his analysis to accommodate occasional deviations from convention and @skyrms2023 even introduces *quasi-conventions* as unstable conventions based on yet another equilibrium concept of *coarse correlated equilibrium*. Despite this, much of the academic discourse focuses on the strict version of his definition.

Lewisian convention is a particular instance of NE (Nash equilibrium). In NE, no participant can improve their outcome by unilaterally changing their strategy. If deviation strictly reduces payoff, the equilibrium is considered strict. In this sense, NE represents a "steady state," where each individual acts optimally given the actions of others. However, Lewisian convention extends beyond NE by emphasizing collective preference for conformity, even when minor deviations occur. Such equilibria are referred to as *coordination equilibria*.

Lewis's framework highlights *arbitrariness* in conventions, where $R$ is defined as a convention only if an alternative $R'$ could serve equally well. This acknowledges that conventions are contingent choices among possible solutions rather than inherent necessities which continues the insights of Quine [@quine1969], Putnam [@putnam1975] and others.

Additionally, Lewis introduced the concept of *common knowledge* and made it a condition for a regularity to be a convention, where a fact $p$ is common knowledge if:

- Everyone knows $p$.
- Everyone knows that everyone knows $p$.
- Everyone knows that everyone knows that everyone knows $p$, and so on.

This recursive understanding of knowledge has spurred extensive discussion in both philosophical and game-theoretic literature. Aumann [@aumann1976] and Schiffer [@schiffer1972] have developed formalizations of common knowledge, diverging from Lewis’s original informal approach. 

As we will tour this and other aspects of Lewis's theory in detail later in this chapter, it suffices to mention that further reception of his theory saw the common knowledge requirement too cognitively demanding and unrealistic [@gilbert1992; @binmore2008; @camerer2003; @bicchieri2005; @vanderschraaf1998].

As Lewis's theory uses game theory, rationality plays a fundamental role in Lewis's framework. He assumes that agents are instrumentally rational, meaning they choose actions that maximize their expected utility given their beliefs and expectations about the world and the behavior of others. Although the entire metaphor of humans as maximizing agents has been questioned [@paternotte2020a], it still serves as guidance in economic theory [@gintis2007; @gintis2013], biology [@okasha2017; @okasha2012; @engel2008] and human ecology [@mouden2012a; @sterelny2012]. However, there are alternative views on the requirement of agent's rationality for conventions to exist. @millikan2022 suggests that conventions stabilize only by the weight of precedent, thus not requiring any rationality or consciousness. We will look closer at such alternative in the third chapter of the thesis while discussing complex signaling as a source of the transition from 'animal conventions' to human social institutions.

Lewis's notion of conventions weaves behavior, beliefs, preferences, and expectations into a framework of common knowledge and rationality to explain the stability of conventions. Each part of the definition is vital: common knowledge ensures a shared understanding of the convention, the preference for conformity incentivizes adherence given others' cooperation, and rationality guides individual choices within the context of shared expectations.

As a primary motivation for Lewis's analysis was to address the philosophical problem of linguistic meaning, he aimed to argue that language is grounded in conventions which do not require up-front agreement on terms. Just as drivers coordinate on a side to drive without a formal contract, speakers of a language develop conventions of using sounds or gestures to refer to specific things through repeated interaction and mutual expectations. Lewis viewed language as a system of signaling, where meaning arises from the conventional association between signals (words, phrases) and states of the world. For example, the word "cat" conventionally signals the presence of a feline. This convention is sustained because speakers generally intend to be truthful and listeners generally trust that they are being told the truth. This mutual expectation and reliance on the regularity of signal-meaning pairings allows for effective communication, which is a form of coordination.

This led Lewis to delineate *behavioral* and *signaling* conventions [@lewis2008, 147-150], where the former coordinate actions and the former coordinate meaning. As a prototypical example of a signaling convention, Lewis gives a story of Paul Revere and the lanterns hung in the steeple of the Old North Church used to warn colonial militia about approaching British Troops in 1775. Two hung lanterns conveyed that troops are advancing by sea, one—by land. Additionally, the actions of the receiver of the message, given each of these signals, would differ. In other words, senders and receivers of a message coordinate on following a pre-established pattern of "if X, do Y" like in the example with lanterns[^skyrms-learning].

[^skyrms-learning]: As Skyrms has shown [-@skyrms2010; -@skyrms2010a], the pattern can be learned dynamically in iterated games: both X and Y can be established and recognized with trial-and-error via reinforcement learning.

For Lewis, signaling conventions are a special case, or a subclass, of behavioral conventions as they share basic properties like arbitrariness, conformity and being common knowledge. Signaling conventions differ in that they involve communication and interpretation of meaning and solve coordination problems by *information transfer*. They require encoding/decoding which is producing and interpreting signals. 

An important feature of the relationship between these two classes of conventions is that, according to Lewis, signaling conventions fundamentally rely upon and are shaped by pre-existing behavioral conventions. For example, language meanings of words depend on both parties' adherence to established norms of pronunciation and grammar. Signaling systems frequently exhibit nesting, where specific conventions are embedded within larger behavioral regularities. For instance, raising one’s hand to speak during a meeting is a signaling conventions nested within a broader behavioral convention of turn-taking.

There is a formal distinction between behavioral, or "general" as Lewis call it, and signaling conventions. In signaling games, the players can be either senders or receivers, where the former owns private information about the world state and send a signal about it and the latter observes the signal and acts on it. More formally, it looks like the following:

1. **World states**: L (left) and R (right)
2. **Signals**: V₁ and V₂
3. **Actions**: Aᴸ (left action) and Aᴿ (right action)

| Role       | Strategy | Description                           |
|------------|----------|---------------------------------------|
| **Sender** | S₁       | Signal V₁ if L, V₂ if R               |
|            | S₂       | Signal V₂ if L, V₁ if R               |
| **Receiver** | R₁      | Choose Aᴸ if V₁, Aᴿ if V₂            |
|            | R₂       | Choose Aᴿ if V₁, Aᴸ if V₂            |

$$
\begin{array}{c|c|c}
 & \text{R₁} & \text{R₂} \\
\hline
\text{S₁} & (1,1) & (0,0) \\
\text{S₂} & (0,0) & (1,1) \\
\end{array}
$$

- **Alignment**: Both players receive payoff 1 when action matches the true state
- **Miscoordination**: Zero payoffs when action mismatches the state
- **Signaling equilibria**:
  - (S₁, R₁): Truthful signaling and proper response
  - (S₂, R₂): Systematic signal inversion with matching response

One of the paradigmatic examples of signaling systems in nature is alarm calls specific for each type of predator. For example, vervet monkeys have a call for for seeing eagles which conveys hiding in the grass and a call for seeing a snake conveying climbing on a tree [@seyfarth1990]. A perfect connection between a world state, signal and action comprises a signaling system. 

Although formally similar, as both behavioral and signaling conventions can be described as games with players and payoffs, they differ in that the latter have an additional "layer" of information between players. And although Lewis himself proclaimed signaling conventions a subcategory of behavioral ones, the relationship between them is not clear. For Skyrms, signals *inform* action, and signaling networks *coordinate* action, which implicitly conveys signaling conventions as underpinning behavioral ones. Skyrms further suggests that signaling is responsible for the evolution of teamwork itself [@skyrms2010], which questions Lewis's hierarchical categorization and creates a version of a chicken-and-egg problem. We will look closer at the relationship between behavioral and signaling  conventions and its role in emergence of social institutions in the third chapter.


### Criticisms 
Lewis's theory has been criticized on many grounds, and, as @rescorla2024 notes, virtually every component of his theory has been under attack: from imprecise notion of equilibrium concept to the very necessity of conventions for solving coordination problems. Many criticisms have been met in refinements and extensions of Lewis's theory by later scholars. 

There are five main areas of criticism of Lewis's account of conventions:

1. conformity requirement / hidden normativity
2. overestimation of arbitrariness
3. common knowledge requirement and source of salience
4. connection between conventions and coordination problems
5. imprecise equilibrium concept

#### Conformity requirement / hidden normativity
One of the major criticisms of Lewis's theory of conventions is unrealistic conformity requirement expressed of his 4-th clause: "each person prefers universal conformity to $R$, provided that nearly everyone else adheres to it". As some scholars points out, this strict requirement rules out such regularities as sending thank-you notes after dinner [@gilbert1992] as non-conventional, for they do not require complete conformity. Many commentators find this unintuitive as we usually call any mutually expected behavioral regularity a convention regardless of its level of conformity. 

However, a possible defense of Lewis's position is to restrict a social group where convention takes place and to add that "each person *within a certain social group* prefers universal conformity to $R$…". This addition addresses Gilbert's criticism in that it supports an idea of near-complete conformity relative to the scale and size of a social group with operative convention. If sending thank-you notes after a dinner within a certain group is indeed a convention, not writing such a note would at least disappoint a dinner host. Of course, this might not impose any external sanctions on a guest not writing a thank-you note. However, conformity relative to group size highlights inherent normativity in the form close to normative expectation, which @bicchieri2005 considers an essential ingredient of social norms rather than conventions.

As can be seen, a convention's level of conformity poses a deeper problem, that of normativity of conventions. The level of conformity helps distinguish between conventions as regularities *de facto* and *de jure*  [@rescorla2024], where the former describe actual behavior and the latter prescribe how individuals should behave in certain situations. Lewis himself anticipated such objections and claimed that conventions eventually become social norms. This claim later generated a major controversy over the relationship between those [@bicchieri2023]. Level of conformity points to a problem of the source of such conformity, which concerns Lewis's critics.

@gilbert1992 contends that Lewis’s account ignores the normative force of conventions. For Gilbert, the source of conformity of conventions is *joint commitments* that bind participants to collective ends, creating obligations to conform and justifying criticism of defectors. Lewis’s model, which reduces conventions to equilibrium strategies in coordination games, cannot explain why individuals feel *obliged* to comply with conventions (e.g., stopping at red lights) or apologize for breaching them. Gilbert also disputes Lewis’s focus on coordination problems, arguing that many conventions like etiquette rules lack clear coordination benefits and instead reflect shared commitments. In Lewis, there is appeal to instrumental rationality which maximizes expected value and avoids sanctions, but some scholars see this as insufficient to substantiate conventions. 

For instance, @guala2010 study the extent to which Lewis conventions are normative. He addresses both theoretical and empirical aspects and conclude that Lewis has put forward a scientific theory of conventions and not an analysis of the folk notion, and that conventions do indeed have intrinsic normativity beyond that of instrumental rationality. However, there is another strand of scholars that disagree and put forward that the only normativity of conventions is that of instrumental rationality [@gold2007; @bacharach1997].

In experimental settings, given an iterated Ultimatum or Prisoner dilemma game, only 29% of potential deviants in the lab choose to breach emergent convention [@guala2010]. As Guala and Mittone argue, players in these experiments may unintentionally create extra pressure to conform with their shared history of action, beyond the requirements of rational decision-making and social norms. However, the exact mechanism of additional normative expectation formation is to be discovered. 

From this, Guala concludes that Lewis' model provides an incomplete account of conventions' ontology. Data suggest that Lewis Conventions acquire normative force through repeated play, and any future model must account for this. This has non-trivial implications for theory and practice, as it implies that habits and customs may be hard to disrupt. 

In a similar vein, @hindriks2019 claims that instrumental rationality cannot motivate adherence to conventions and norms and their perception as legitimate. Instrumental rationality with its costs and expected utilities fails to capture the motivation by the normative part of convention itself and not by the costs of its violation. Hindriks claims that it is *normative expectations* and *normative beliefs* that complement sanctions as a source for norm existence and perception as legitimate. 

#### Overestimation of arbitrariness
Overestimation of arbitrariness is another area of criticism. According to Lewis, arbitrariness is one of the key distinguishing aspects of conventions. However, as @gilbert1992 points out, not all possible solutions to a coordination problem are equally profitable for players. In cases where one way of coordinating is more preferred than another, convention will not be that arbitrary. In other words, alternative conventions are logically justified, but pragmatically implausible as there is almost always a slight "preference" of one convention over the other due to different factors like historical accident and history of play. Later scholars talked about this in terms of symmetry-breaking by stochastic events [@skyrms2010; @skyrms2010a] and salience of conventions amplified by the history of iteratively playing a certain coordination game [@korbak2021a]. 

Arbitrariness was recast as a continuum between contingency and necessity, or conventionality and functionality [@oconnor2019]. Signaling between vervet monkeys might well be modeled as a convention in the Lewisian sense of repeated behavioral patterns of solving coordination problems [@harms2004; @skyrms2010]. However, this convention is not historically contingent in the sense of several possible solutions being equally profitable as Lewis supposes and as Gilbert critiques, for there are evolutionary constraints breaking the symmetry between multiple equilibria. Agents might be (and most probably are) hardwired to following certain strategies in certain environmental conditions. This distinction, as O'Connor underlines, highlights some conventions as more functional and others as more conventions. 

@oconnor2021 goes further and proposes an information-theoretic measure for conventionality, or arbitrariness of a convention, applicable to both human “animal” conventions like that of vervet monkeys. As she is most interested in the emergence of cultural traits like gendered division of labor, she says that most cultural traits are both functional and arbitrary, or contingent, for they “might have been otherwise”.

O'Connor notes that Lewis's notion of convention emphasizes arbitrariness, for a coordination game has at least two *proper coordination equilibria* — a state of a strategic situation where no player can deviate from a selected strategy and improve the payoff for any other player. It means that either of them might have been established equiprobably. In line with this, @simons2019 illustrate the distinction of functional and arbitrary conventions by putting it along three dimensions:

1. Payoff difference — some coordination equilibria have bigger payoffs than others;
2. Likelihood of emergence — some conventions are more likely to emerge than others;
3. Stability — once these conventions have emerged, they are unlikely to be deviated from.

O'Connor proposes to layer these dimensions onto evolutionary models, namely those of replicator dynamics[^replicator-dynamics]. It allows for specifying what Simons and Zollman mean by the likelihood of emergence (2) and stability of conventions (3).

[^replicator-dynamics]:

\end{array}

**A coordination game where B equilibrium is more favorable given $x > 1$**

Modelled as replicator dynamics, the game on the figure above has B equilibrium as more “natural” in the sense (1) — that of a higher payoff. The corollary of this is a larger basin of attraction. Given $x = 50$, the phase diagram for this game will look like this:

The basin of attraction for A equilibrium takes up 2% of space, while 98% for B. These basins can represent the probability that each outcome evolves, given little information about the initial conditions of the population. Thus, B is more likely to emerge and is more “natural” in the sense (2).

To propose a measure of conventionality, O'Connor focuses on naturalness of conventions as their probability of emergence (2). As has been shown, different equilibria might evolve with different probability, and the sizes of basins indicate the amount of information we gain from examining an evolutionary process. The amount of information in this process is a *measure of arbitrariness* of a convention. It increases with greater uncertainty about what will evolve and decreases with less.

The relevant information-theoretic measure is Shannon entropy. It measures the average amount of information transmitted through a channel: $H(x) = \sum_{i} P(x_{i})I(x_{i})$. The amount of information gained from observing something is related to how much we learn or how surprised we are. It is calculated by summing the probabilities of the signals $P(x_i)$ multiplied by their information content $I(x_{i})$, with $I(x_{i})$ equal to $-\log_{2}P(x_{i})$ — the less probable a signal, the more information it carries. Overall, this weights the probability of each signal being sent by the amount of information it carries, giving a measure of average information in the channel.[^1]

If other conditions hold, a channel has higher entropy when signals are more equiprobable or there are more signals. This is as opposed to a biased channel, with one signal sent 99% of the time, which has an entropy of just $0.08$. Therefore, more equiprobable signals and more signals lead to higher entropy. As probabilities $P(x_{i})$ represent the sizes of the basins of attraction, learning more from an evolutionary process increases the arbitrariness of an evolving phenomenon in question. Given more equilibria or if their basins of attraction are close to equal, the phenomenon is more arbitrary, contingent or “conventional”.

It is possible to measure the naturalness of a convention similar to @simons2019 using $-\log_{2}P(x)$, which represents the information value of a particular outcome. The closer the value of $-\log_{2}P(x)$ to $0$, the more natural a convention is. This measure can be used whenever we have clear probabilities for different evolutionary outcomes. However, if there is uncertainty about the initial conditions of a population, it is possible to assign probabilities to different population starting places and not their basins of attraction, for they will not track the probability of emergence correctly. Another case is stochastic dynamics, where each starting point might lead to multiple equilibria depending on chance events. Here, $P(x_{i})$ can be defined as percentage of emergence of different equilibria in an iterated game. For example, if 10 individuals play the game in the figure above with $x=10$ 10K times, it yields 6% chance of emergence of A, and 94% for B.

As O'Connor notes, one problem with a proposed conventionality measure is the source of probabilities. It means that inputs in an entropy equation can be selected quite arbitrarily depending on a case (which is ironic but predictable). As there are no actual chances, it can be hard to determine, whether a convention might have been otherwise. To address this worry, she underlines the representation-dependence of the measure. We can specify what is probability in terms of a particular model or data set, for instance, basins of attraction, emergence over multiple rounds of simulation, equilibrium time and percentage of societies adopting a behavior. This eliminates worries about probability and chance in the world. However, representations should be tailored to the intended explanatory goals. However, as representations have limitations, the proposed measure should not be taken as an absolute truth.

A similar line of criticism comes from @burge1975, who notes that Lewisian requirement for convention to involve mutual knowledge of *alternative regularities*, or practices that could replace existing ones if widely adopted, is too strict. Conventions might fix without agents' knowledge of alternatives, Burge argues. He contends that conventions can stabilize with habit, custom or tradition, widely following Hume's original argument, and that knowledge of alternative conventions is not needed. Conventions, as Burge argues, are not governed by any biological, psychological or sociological law, they are historically accident. In addition, agents do not necessarily deliberate to "switch" from one convention to another. In terms of game theory, Lewis requires that agents know the structure of the game with its multiple equilibria, whereas Burge's notion does not. This leads to yet another point of criticism, overly intellectualist requirements for agents.

<!--### 3. **Epistemic Overreach: Common Knowledge and Rationality**  -->
<!--Lewis’s requirement of **common knowledge**—that all parties know the convention and know that others know it—faces skepticism. Giacomo Sillari notes that evolutionary game theory demonstrates conventions can emerge *without* common knowledge, via trial-and-error learning or imitation[3]. Robert Sugden and others argue that Lewis conflates *common knowledge* with *common reason to believe*, which is less cognitively demanding[3]. Additionally, Burge and Gilbert highlight that Lewis overstates human rationality: conventions often persist through unconscious habit or social inertia, not deliberate equilibrium selection[5][4].-->

<!--### 4. **Empirical Limitations**  -->
<!--Francesco Guala questions whether “Lewis Conventions” exist in the real world. While Lewis’s model elegantly explains *some* conventions (e.g., driving sides), many real-world practices (e.g., gender roles) involve **normative enforcement** (e.g., sanctions) absent from his theory[4]. Guala argues that Lewis’s non-normative, game-theoretic framework struggles to explain why deviations from conventions provoke moral criticism rather than mere coordination failures[4].-->

<!--### Conclusion  -->
<!--Lewis’s theory remains foundational for analyzing conventions through game theory, but its critics highlight key gaps:  -->
<!--- **Unnecessary cognitive demands**: Common knowledge and explicit recognition of alternatives are often unrealistic[1][3][5].  -->

<!--- **Empirical mismatch**: Real-world conventions frequently involve normative enforcement and social power dynamics[4].  -->

<!--Another significant area of criticism surrounds Lewis's conceptualization of common knowledge . While Lewis is often credited with introducing the concept of common knowledge, his definition as an infinite hierarchy of "reasons to believe" diverges significantly from the more standard modern understanding, which typically involves actual knowledge and its iterative nature . This weaker form of common knowledge, where individuals have reasons to believe that others have reasons to believe, and so on, might not provide a sufficiently robust foundation for the stability and predictability of conventions. For many conventions, especially those with important consequences for non-compliance, a stronger sense of shared understanding and expectation seems necessary. For instance, in the convention of driving on a particular side of the road, it appears more crucial that individuals largely know that others will adhere to the convention, rather than merely having a reason to believe they will. Lewis himself acknowledged that the term "common knowledge" might be a misnomer for his concept, suggesting "common reason to believe" as a more accurate description . Furthermore, if common knowledge is based on reasons to believe rather than actual knowledge, it raises concerns about the potential for widespread error and the justification of actions based on conventions . If everyone in a population has a reason to believe something false, and a convention is built upon this shared but incorrect belief, the resulting actions might be misguided or ineffective.   -->
<!---->
<!--Critics also argue that Lewis's theory primarily offers a static account of conventions and struggles to explain their emergence and evolution over time . While Lewis describes the conditions under which a convention exists, his framework provides less insight into the dynamic processes through which conventions initially arise, how they adapt to changing circumstances, or why some conventions eventually dissolve. The emergence of conventions likely involves more than just individuals independently stumbling into mutually beneficial regularities. Factors such as learning, adaptation, social influence, and explicit communication seem to play crucial roles in shaping and maintaining conventions, aspects that are not fully captured by Lewis's model . While Lewis acknowledges the importance of precedence and salience in the selection of one equilibrium over others in a coordination problem , these concepts primarily explain the maintenance of an existing convention rather than its initial genesis. For example, the fact that a convention has been followed in the past (precedence) can explain why it continues to be followed, but it does not fully account for why that particular convention arose in the first place among multiple equally viable alternatives. The "first driver" problem illustrates this: Lewis's theory explains why people in Britain drive on the left because everyone else has done so historically and is expected to continue , but it doesn't fully explain why the initial decision to drive on the left was made.   -->
<!---->
<!--A significant critique of Lewis’s theory is its focus on purely self-interested motivations and non-normative expectations, which many argue fails to capture the normative force often associated with conventions . Many real-world conventions seem to carry a sense of obligation or a reason to conform that extends beyond mere personal benefit in coordinating with others. Consider conventions like queuing or basic etiquette; while there is a coordination aspect to these practices, there also appears to be a social expectation that one should adhere to them. Lewis's theory distinguishes between conventions and social norms, with social norms typically involving normative expectations and often being backed by sanctions . Critics argue that this sharp separation might not accurately reflect the reality of many social conventions, where normative considerations are often intertwined with the self-interested motivations for coordination. While Lewis acknowledges that conventions might be supported by external normative considerations and sanctions , treating these as separate from the convention itself might obscure the fact that the normative aspect is often integral to why people follow certain conventions. The fear of social disapproval or even sanctions can be a powerful motivator for conforming to a convention, suggesting that normativity is not just an external layer but a fundamental component of many social practices.   -->
<!---->
<!--Furthermore, the applicability of Lewis's model, which is primarily based on coordination problems with shared interests, to all types of social conventions has been questioned . Lewis’s framework seems best suited for situations where individuals have a common goal and multiple ways of achieving it, where any coordinated action is better than no coordination. However, many social conventions, including moral norms and conventions around resource distribution, involve conflicting interests or may not have clearly defined coordination benefits for all participants . For instance, conventions related to social hierarchy or power dynamics might benefit some groups more than others, making it difficult to model them solely as solutions to coordination problems with mutual benefits. Additionally, Lewis's condition that "almost everyone conforms" to a convention might be too stringent, as some conventions can exist even with relatively low levels of compliance . Moreover, the assumption that alternative conventions are equally beneficial might not always hold in reality; some conventions might be objectively more efficient, fair, or desirable than others .   -->
<!---->
<!--Several alternative philosophical theories of convention have emerged that attempt to address some of the limitations of Lewis's account . Some theories emphasize the role of rules rather than just behavioral regularities, arguing that conventions often involve an understanding and acceptance of underlying rules that guide behavior . Theories focusing on collective intentions and "plural subjects" suggest that conventions are maintained through shared intentions and a sense of acting together as a group, potentially offering a way to address the initial agreement problem and the normative aspects of conventions . Evolutionary game theory provides a framework for understanding how conventions can emerge and become stable over time through repeated interactions and evolutionary pressures . Other approaches directly incorporate the role of normative expectations and sanctions in the definition and maintenance of social norms and conventions . The concept of tacit agreement, as emphasized by Locke, offers an alternative to explicit agreement in explaining the origins of some conventions . The constraint view of conventionality argues that while conventions might seem arbitrary, they are often constrained by non-conventional concerns such as welfare, which can help explain the applicability of conventions to diverse situations . The following table summarizes some of these alternative perspectives:   -->

<!--Overall, Lewis's account of conventions raised several key topics within the study of conventions: salience, common knowledge, arbitrariness and normativity, which we will discuss in the next section.-->

<!--### Extensions of Lewis's Theory-->

<!--Peter Vanderschraaf has significantly refined and extended Lewis's theory of convention by defining it as a correlated equilibrium that satisfies a public intentions criterion 32.

<!--The concept of correlated equilibrium, introduced by Robert Aumann, is a generalization of Nash equilibrium 23. In a correlated equilibrium, players coordinate their strategies based on a shared observation of a random signal or some other common information 23. For example, in the classic game of "Battle of the Sexes," where one player prefers going to the opera and the other prefers going to a boxing match, a correlated strategy could be to go to the opera if a coin flip lands heads and to the boxing match if it lands tails. If both players observe the same outcome of the coin flip, they can coordinate their actions to achieve a preferred outcome over the undesirable outcomes of going to different events 23. Vanderschraaf argues that many real-world conventions can be better understood as correlated equilibria rather than just Nash equilibria 32.-->

<!--In addition to the concept of correlated equilibrium, Vanderschraaf introduces the public intentions criterion, which states that every agent wants their intended action to be common knowledge 32. This criterion formalizes the idea that for a convention to be established and maintained, individuals must not only coordinate their actions but also have a shared understanding of each other's intentions to conform to the convention 32.-->
<!---->
<!--Vanderschraaf also focuses on the emergence of conventions, suggesting that the selection of a particular correlated equilibrium as a convention requires a theory of equilibrium selection that goes beyond Lewis's work 32. He proposes modeling agents as a dynamical system of inductive deliberators who adjust their beliefs about each other recursively, eventually converging to a correlated equilibrium 33.-->
<!---->
<!--Vanderschraaf's refinements offer a more sophisticated game-theoretic framework for understanding conventions. By incorporating correlated equilibrium and the public intentions criterion, his theory can potentially capture a wider range of conventional behaviors, including those where coordination relies on shared information beyond just individual expectations of others' actions.-->
<!---->
<!--Brian Skyrms-->
<!--Brian Skyrms has approached the study of convention through the lens of evolutionary game theory, focusing on how conventions emerge and are sustained over time through processes of learning and adaptation 2. Unlike Lewis's primarily rationalistic account, Skyrms emphasizes the dynamic aspects of convention, exploring how repeated interactions and evolutionary pressures can lead to the establishment of stable behavioral patterns 12.-->
<!---->
<!--Skyrms utilizes models of learning and evolution, such as replicator dynamics, to understand how certain strategies or behaviors become more prevalent in a population over time 36. These models show how strategies that yield higher payoffs or fitness tend to spread, while less successful strategies decline 39. In the context of convention, Skyrms demonstrates how cooperative strategies in coordination games can evolve and become stable within a population through repeated interactions, even without the need for strong common knowledge in the Lewisian sense 12.-->
<!---->
<!--Skyrms has also made significant contributions to the understanding of signaling games and the evolution of communication 17. Signaling games model situations where one agent (the sender) has private information and sends a signal to another agent (the receiver), who then takes an action based on the signal 17. Skyrms's work explores how meaningful communication, which is a form of convention, can emerge spontaneously through evolutionary processes in these games 31.-->
<!---->
<!--Furthermore, Skyrms has investigated the concept of correlated conventions, where agents use an asymmetry to coordinate their behavior 38. He explores how such conventions can evolve and the role of arbitrary asymmetries in their formation 40.-->
<!---->
<!--Skyrms's work offers a valuable evolutionary perspective on convention, highlighting how stable and coordinated behavior can arise through dynamic processes of learning and adaptation, providing an alternative and complementary approach to Lewis's more static and rationality-focused theory.-->
<!---->
<!--Herbert Gintis-->
<!--Herbert Gintis offers a perspective on convention that integrates game theory with social norms and moral commitments 26. Gintis argues that human behavior cannot be fully explained by rational self-interest alone and that internalized social norms play a crucial role in shaping our preferences and actions, particularly in strategic interactions 37.-->
<!---->
<!--Gintis critiques the assumption of common knowledge of rationality in standard game theory, arguing that it is often unrealistic and fails to account for the observed patterns of human behavior 37. He suggests that social norms act as correlation devices that help agents coordinate on particular equilibria in games, often leading to outcomes that are more cooperative or socially desirable than those predicted by purely self-interested rationality 53.-->
<!---->
<!--For Gintis, social norms are often internalized, meaning individuals feel a moral obligation to follow them, even when doing so might not maximize their immediate material self-interest 37. This internalization of norms can explain why people cooperate in situations like the Prisoner's Dilemma, where rational self-interest would dictate defection 10.-->
<!---->
<!--Gintis's broader aim is to unify the behavioral sciences by integrating insights from game theory, sociology, and psychology to develop a more comprehensive model of human decision-making 37. He argues that understanding social norms and their influence on individual preferences is essential for explaining the emergence and maintenance of conventions and social order 37.-->
<!---->
<!--Gintis's work extends the analysis of convention by emphasizing the critical role of social norms and moral commitments in shaping human behavior and facilitating coordination, offering a richer and more behaviorally grounded perspective than purely rationalistic accounts.-->
<!---->
<!--This table highlights a progression in the theory of convention. Lewis's work laid the groundwork by focusing on rational coordination under conditions of common knowledge. Vanderschraaf built upon this by introducing the more general game-theoretic concept of correlated equilibrium and emphasizing public intentions. Skyrms shifted the focus to the evolutionary dynamics of convention, exploring how stable patterns of behavior can emerge through repeated interactions and adaptation. Finally, Gintis integrated the role of social norms and moral commitments, arguing that these factors are essential for a complete understanding of human behavior and coordination in the context of conventions.-->
<!---->
<!--Conclusion-->
<!--The study of social conventions has evolved significantly since David Lewis's foundational work. Lewis provided a rigorous analysis of convention rooted in game theory, emphasizing the role of coordination problems, common knowledge, and rationality. His theory offered a powerful framework for understanding how shared patterns of behavior can emerge and persist in the absence of explicit agreements, and it had a profound influence on the philosophy of language.-->
<!---->
<!--Ongoing debates in the field include the precise role and necessity of common knowledge, the mechanisms by which social norms are internalized and influence behavior, and the best way to integrate rational choice and evolutionary perspectives in the study of convention. Future research could further explore the cognitive and psychological foundations of convention, the influence of culture and institutions in shaping conventional behavior, and the application of these theories to address contemporary social issues.-->
<!---->
<!--In conclusion, the study of convention remains a vital area of inquiry in social philosophy, offering critical insights into the foundations of social order, cooperation, and communication. The progression from Lewis's seminal work to the nuanced perspectives of later scholars like Vanderschraaf, Skyrms, and Gintis demonstrates the ongoing effort to develop a comprehensive and accurate understanding of this fundamental aspect of social life.-->

## Common knowledge and cognitive requirements for conventions

<!--**Introduction: The Concept of Common Knowledge and its-->
<!--Interdisciplinary Significance**-->
<!---->
<!--The concept of common knowledge describes a particular epistemic state-->
<!--within a group of agents. It signifies a situation where a proposition-->
<!--*p* is not only known by every member of the group, but also where every-->
<!--member knows that every other member knows *p*, and this knowledge-->
<!--extends to an infinite level of iteration.^1^ This recursive nature,-->
<!--where knowledge about knowledge is itself known and so forth,-->
<!--distinguishes common knowledge from mere mutual knowledge, which only-->
<!--requires that each individual knows *p*.^2^ The implications of this-->
<!--distinction are profound, particularly when considering coordination and-->
<!--strategic interaction among individuals. The stringent conditions-->
<!--required for common knowledge to hold suggest that it represents an-->
<!--idealized epistemic state, prompting investigations into its feasibility-->
<!--and relevance in real-world scenarios.-->
<!---->
<!--The notion of common knowledge has proven to be a cornerstone in various-->
<!--academic disciplines. In philosophy, it is central to understanding how-->
<!--individuals coordinate their actions, establish social conventions, and-->
<!--interpret meaning.^2^ Economics utilizes common knowledge, especially-->
<!--within game theory, to model agents\' information and explain phenomena-->
<!--such as trade under uncertainty.^4^ Game theory itself relies heavily on-->
<!--the assumption of common knowledge to define equilibrium concepts and-->
<!--refine predictions about strategic behavior.^4^ Furthermore, cognitive-->
<!--science explores common knowledge in relation to social cognition,-->
<!--particularly in the context of theory of mind -- the ability to-->
<!--understand others\' mental states -- and the foundations of shared-->
<!--intentionality.^2^ Given its widespread relevance, the analysis of-->
<!--common knowledge requires a multi-faceted approach that draws upon-->
<!--insights from these diverse fields. The first comprehensive-->
<!--philosophical treatment of this concept was provided by David Lewis in-->
<!--his groundbreaking 1969 book, \"Convention,\" which laid the foundation-->
<!--for much of the subsequent research and debate surrounding common-->
<!--knowledge.^1^-->
<!---->
<!--**David Lewis\'s Foundation: Common Knowledge in \"Convention\" (1969)**-->
<!---->
<!--In \"Convention,\" David Lewis presented a compelling argument that-->
<!--language and other social conventions are fundamentally rooted in-->
<!--regularities of action that emerge to solve recurring coordination-->
<!--problems, rather than being the product of explicit agreements or-->
<!--contracts.^8^ Lewis contended that in situations where multiple courses-->
<!--of action could lead to a mutually desirable outcome, a particular-->
<!--regularity might become established simply because individuals find it-->
<!--advantageous to adhere to that pattern, provided that others do the-->
<!--same. This perspective shifts the focus from explicit negotiation to the-->
<!--power of mutual expectations in shaping social behavior. For instance,-->
<!--the convention of driving on a particular side of the road in a country-->
<!--arises not from a signed agreement among all drivers, but from the-->
<!--shared expectation that others will follow this rule, making it rational-->
<!--for each individual to do so as well.^8^-->
<!---->
<!--Lewis provided a detailed definition of a convention, specifying several-->
<!--conditions that must be met for a regularity in behavior to qualify as-->
<!--such.^8^ Crucially, his definition includes the requirement that this-->
<!--regularity *R*, along with related clauses such as the expectation that-->
<!--everyone else will conform to *R* and the preference to conform to *R*-->
<!--on the condition that others do, must be common knowledge within the-->
<!--population *P*. This emphasis on common knowledge underscores its-->
<!--importance in ensuring the stability and self-enforcing nature of-->
<!--conventions. If individuals merely expected others to follow a-->
<!--regularity without this expectation being common knowledge, the basis-->
<!--for their own conformity would be less secure. The shared understanding-->
<!--at multiple levels -- I expect you to follow the rule, I expect you to-->
<!--expect me to follow the rule, and so on -- provides a robust foundation-->
<!--for the convention to persist.-->
<!---->
<!--Interestingly, Lewis\'s initial conceptualization of common knowledge-->
<!--differed somewhat from the standard modern understanding. He defined it-->
<!--as a state where a proposition *p* is common knowledge if and only if-->
<!--there exists a state of affairs *A* such that everyone has a reason to-->
<!--believe that *A* holds, *A* indicates to everyone that everyone has a-->
<!--reason to believe that *A* holds, and *A* indicates to everyone that-->
<!--*p*.^8^ This definition leads to an infinite chain of \"reasons to-->
<!--believe\" rather than an infinite chain of \"knowledge.\" This subtle-->
<!--distinction suggests a more pragmatic approach, potentially-->
<!--acknowledging the limitations of human epistemic capabilities. Instead-->
<!--of requiring absolute certainty at every level of iterated knowledge,-->
<!--Lewis focused on the justification for holding beliefs about the state-->
<!--of affairs and others\' beliefs about it. The examples Lewis employed,-->
<!--such as the convention of driving on the right side of the road and the-->
<!--acceptance of certain pieces of paper as payment, illustrate how these-->
<!--conventions function effectively because of a shared understanding and-->
<!--expectation of others\' behavior, even if this understanding might not-->
<!--always reach the level of absolute, iterated knowledge.^8^-->
<!---->
<!--**Philosophical Refinements of Common Knowledge**-->
<!---->
<!--**Epistemic Iteration and Bounded Rationality:**-->
<!---->
<!--Cristina Bicchieri, in her 1993 work \"Rationality and Coordination,\"-->
<!--offered a critical perspective on the assumption of unbounded knowledge-->
<!--inherent in the standard definition of common knowledge, particularly as-->
<!--it relates to achieving coordination.^9^ While Lewis\'s account-->
<!--emphasized the role of common knowledge in conventions, Bicchieri argued-->
<!--that real-world agents operate under cognitive constraints, possessing-->
<!--bounded rationality.^13^ This limitation makes the infinite regress of-->
<!--knowledge required by the standard definition seem psychologically-->
<!--implausible. Individuals have finite processing capacity and memory,-->
<!--making it unlikely they can engage in or rely on an infinite number of-->
<!--nested beliefs about others\' beliefs. Therefore, Bicchieri suggested-->
<!--that coordination often occurs with significantly less epistemic-->
<!--certainty than what strict common knowledge demands.-->
<!---->
<!--Her research delved into how agents form beliefs and expectations about-->
<!--others\' actions in coordination games.^13^ She highlighted the-->
<!--importance of mutual expectations and the possibility of coordination-->
<!--emerging and being sustained through learning and repeated interactions,-->
<!--even in the absence of full common knowledge.^13^ By observing others\'-->
<!--behavior and updating their beliefs over time, individuals can converge-->
<!--towards coordinated outcomes without necessarily possessing a-->
<!--pre-existing state of common knowledge about the situation or each-->
<!--other\'s strategies. Furthermore, Bicchieri explored the significant-->
<!--role of social norms in facilitating coordination.^14^ She proposed that-->
<!--norms often operate through conditional preferences, where individuals-->
<!--prefer to conform to a norm if they expect others to do so, and through-->
<!--normative expectations, which are beliefs about what others think one-->
<!--ought to do.^18^ These mechanisms can lead to coordination even if the-->
<!--norm itself is not common knowledge in the strictest sense, as-->
<!--individuals might simply follow the norm based on their belief that-->
<!--others expect them to and their observation that others are generally-->
<!--conforming.-->
<!---->
<!--Ken Binmore, in his work from 2008 and earlier, also examined common-->
<!--knowledge in the context of social contracts, repeated games, and the-->
<!--evolution of fairness norms.^9^ Binmore argued that social contracts-->
<!--arise from common understandings that evolve through repeated-->
<!--interactions in what he termed the \"game of life\".^20^ While-->
<!--acknowledging that some level of shared knowledge is necessary for these-->
<!--understandings to develop, he questioned whether this knowledge needs to-->
<!--reach the infinite levels required by Lewis\'s or Aumann\'s definition-->
<!--of common knowledge.^23^ Binmore suggested that for agents to coordinate-->
<!--on an equilibrium in a game, they might only need first-order-->
<!--expectations about others\' behavior -- that is, a belief about what-->
<!--others will do -- rather than needing to know that everyone knows these-->
<!--expectations, and so on.^9^ From a game-theoretic perspective, the-->
<!--critical element for coordination might be the ability to accurately-->
<!--predict others\' actions, and rational players will act accordingly-->
<!--based on these expectations.-->
<!---->
<!--Binmore\'s evolutionary approach further emphasized the role of cultural-->
<!--evolution in shaping these common understandings and fairness norms.^20^-->
<!--He proposed that societies develop and transmit norms and conventions-->
<!--over time based on their effectiveness in promoting social coordination-->
<!--and stability. This suggests that the shared knowledge underpinning-->
<!--social order might be a product of a dynamic evolutionary process rather-->
<!--than a static, pre-existing condition of full common knowledge. Cultural-->
<!--evolution provides a mechanism for the refinement and transmission of-->
<!--effective coordination strategies across generations, potentially-->
<!--offering an alternative to purely rationalistic accounts that rely-->
<!--heavily on the assumption of common knowledge.-->
<!---->
<!--**Context-Dependence and Salience:**-->
<!---->
<!--Robert Sugden, in his 1995 work, highlighted the crucial role of-->
<!--context-specific salience in establishing common knowledge and resolving-->
<!--coordination problems.^1^ Sugden proposed that salience, often rooted in-->
<!--shared community membership and cultural context, acts as a correlating-->
<!--device that enables agents to achieve a common understanding and-->
<!--coordinate their actions on a particular equilibrium.^25^ In situations-->
<!--where multiple equilibria exist, salience provides a focal point that-->
<!--individuals are more likely to attend to and expect others to attend to-->
<!--as well, thus breaking the symmetry and facilitating coordination. For-->
<!--example, in Schelling\'s classic coordination games, individuals often-->
<!--converge on the most intuitively obvious or prominent option, which-->
<!--Sugden argued is a manifestation of salience.-->
<!---->
<!--Sugden further contended that common understanding, which is based on-->
<!--shared modes of reasoning within a community, is constitutive of-->
<!--salience.^25^ Individuals who belong to the same community are likely to-->
<!--share similar cultural backgrounds, experiences, and ways of thinking,-->
<!--which in turn influences what they perceive as salient in a given-->
<!--situation. This shared understanding allows them to anticipate which-->
<!--option will stand out not only to themselves but also to others within-->
<!--their community, thereby enabling successful coordination. The basis for-->
<!--this common understanding, according to Sugden, often lies in the fact-->
<!--of community membership itself.-->
<!---->
<!--Herbert Gintis, in his 2009 book \"The Bounds of Reason,\" also-->
<!--addressed the role of salience in the emergence of common knowledge,-->
<!--particularly in the context of social norms and conventions, emphasizing-->
<!--its connection to cultural evolution.^1^ Gintis argued that gene-culture-->
<!--coevolution plays a significant role in shaping human preferences,-->
<!--including a predisposition towards fairness and cooperation.^29^ These-->
<!--evolved preferences can make certain norms and behaviors more salient-->
<!--within a cultural group. For instance, a deeply ingrained cultural value-->
<!--of reciprocity might make cooperative actions more salient in social-->
<!--interactions.-->
<!---->
<!--Gintis suggested that common knowledge frequently arises from events or-->
<!--information that are mutually accessible or self-evident within a group,-->
<!--and this process is facilitated by shared cultural understanding and-->
<!--established social processes.^31^ Public signals, rituals, and the-->
<!--common knowledge of social rules can all contribute to making certain-->
<!--facts or expectations mutually accessible, thus fostering common-->
<!--knowledge. The shared cultural context provides the framework through-->
<!--which individuals interpret these signals and experiences, leading to a-->
<!--shared understanding of their significance.-->
<!---->
<!--**Critiques of the Infinite Recursion Requirement**-->
<!---->
<!--Margaret Gilbert, in her 1989 book \"On Social Facts,\" offered a-->
<!--significant critique of the infinite regress inherent in the standard-->
<!--definitions of common knowledge.^2^ She argued that the requirement of-->
<!--knowing that everyone knows, and so on ad infinitum, is psychologically-->
<!--unrealistic and not necessary to explain various social phenomena,-->
<!--including collective belief and convention.^32^ Gilbert proposed an-->
<!--alternative framework based on the concept of joint commitment. She-->
<!--contended that social facts arise from situations where individuals are-->
<!--jointly committed to intend or believe something as a body, rather than-->
<!--from an infinite hierarchy of individual beliefs about each other\'s-->
<!--beliefs.^32^-->
<!---->
<!--According to Gilbert, joint commitment involves a shared intention or-->
<!--belief held by a group as a collective entity, without necessarily-->
<!--requiring that each individual member personally holds the same-->
<!--intention or belief.^32^ For example, a group might be jointly committed-->
<!--to believing a certain proposition, even if some members harbor private-->
<!--doubts. This framework offers a way to understand shared social states-->
<!--and collective actions without relying on the demanding epistemic-->
<!--requirements of common knowledge. When individuals jointly commit to-->
<!--something, they create shared obligations and expectations that can-->
<!--drive collective behavior and shape shared attitudes, potentially-->
<!--circumventing the need for an infinite regress of mutual knowledge.-->
<!---->
<!--Aviad Heifetz, in his 1999 work, also raised concerns about the-->
<!--paradoxes and limitations associated with the common knowledge-->
<!--assumption, particularly in dynamic settings and games involving-->
<!--temporal imprecision.^2^ Echoing arguments made by Joseph Halpern and-->
<!--Yoram Moses (1990), Heifetz highlighted the practical impossibility of-->
<!--achieving common knowledge in real-world scenarios where communication-->
<!--takes time or might be unreliable.^37^ The requirement of simultaneous-->
<!--knowledge for common knowledge to arise poses a significant challenge to-->
<!--its applicability in many practical contexts. For instance, the-->
<!--coordinated attack problem illustrates how even when two parties have a-->
<!--strong incentive to coordinate, the lack of guaranteed simultaneous-->
<!--communication can prevent the establishment of common knowledge about-->
<!--the decision to attack, potentially leading to suboptimal outcomes.^39^-->
<!---->
<!--These critiques suggest that while the theoretical concept of common-->
<!--knowledge is valuable, its strict definition might not always align with-->
<!--the realities of human cognition and communication in complex-->
<!--environments. Consequently, researchers have explored alternative or-->
<!--weaker notions, such as finite levels of mutual knowledge or the concept-->
<!--of common belief where the probability of shared knowledge approaches-->
<!--one, as potentially more relevant for understanding actual behavior and-->
<!--coordination.^40^ These alternative concepts acknowledge the-->
<!--imperfections of real-world information and the bounded rationality of-->
<!--agents, potentially providing more accurate models of how coordination-->
<!--and cooperation are achieved in practice.-->
<!---->
<!--**Economic Refinements and Game Theory Applications**-->
<!---->
<!--Robert Aumann\'s 1976 paper \"Agreeing to Disagree\" stands as a-->
<!--landmark contribution that brought the concept of common knowledge into-->
<!--the formal realm of game theory and economics.^1^ Aumann provided a-->
<!--rigorous, set-theoretic definition of common knowledge based on-->
<!--partitions of the state space, offering a powerful mathematical tool for-->
<!--analyzing strategic interactions. His formalization defined an event as-->
<!--common knowledge at a particular state if that event includes all states-->
<!--that any player considers possible, all states that any player considers-->
<!--possible for any other player, and so on, ad infinitum.^43^ This-->
<!--rigorous definition enabled the formal analysis of how information is-->
<!--shared and understood among rational agents.-->
<!---->
<!--One of the most significant results stemming from Aumann\'s-->
<!--formalization is the \"agreeing to disagree\" theorem.^40^ This theorem-->
<!--demonstrates that if two or more rational agents share a common prior-->
<!--probability distribution over the states of the world, and if their-->
<!--posterior probabilities about a particular event become common knowledge-->
<!--among them, then these posterior probabilities must be equal. This-->
<!--result has profound implications for understanding belief revision,-->
<!--information aggregation, and the potential for consensus among rational-->
<!--agents. The very fact that a disagreement in probabilities becomes-->
<!--common knowledge implies that the agents should revise their beliefs-->
<!--until they converge, assuming they started with the same underlying-->
<!--beliefs and are reasoning rationally based on their information.-->
<!---->
<!--Drew Fudenberg and Jean Tirole\'s 1991 textbook, \"Game Theory,\"-->
<!--further solidified the importance of common knowledge within the field-->
<!--by systematically integrating it into the explanation and justification-->
<!--of various equilibrium concepts.^1^ Their work illustrates how the-->
<!--assumptions underpinning standard solution concepts in non-cooperative-->
<!--game theory, such as Nash equilibrium, subgame perfection, and Bayesian-->
<!--equilibrium, often implicitly or explicitly rely on some form of common-->
<!--knowledge.^45^ For instance, the concept of Nash equilibrium, where each-->
<!--player\'s strategy is a best response to the strategies of the other-->
<!--players, often assumes that the players have common knowledge of each-->
<!--other\'s rationality and the structure of the game. Similarly, the-->
<!--refinement of subgame perfection, used in dynamic games, relies on the-->
<!--common knowledge of rationality at every stage of the game.-->
<!---->
<!--Fudenberg and Tirole also explored situations characterized by-->
<!--incomplete information, where common knowledge about certain aspects of-->
<!--the game, such as other players\' payoffs or types, might be absent or-->
<!--limited.^45^ In such scenarios, the standard equilibrium concepts might-->
<!--not directly apply, leading to the development of more specialized-->
<!--concepts like Bayesian equilibrium and perfect Bayesian equilibrium.-->
<!--These concepts are designed to handle situations where players have-->
<!--private information and must reason about the beliefs and potential-->
<!--actions of others based on their own information and their understanding-->
<!--of the information structure of the game. The analysis of these-->
<!--situations underscores the critical role of understanding the epistemic-->
<!--landscape -- what is known, what is believed, and what is common-->
<!--knowledge (or not) -- in predicting strategic behavior.-->
<!---->
<!--**Evolutionary Game Theory and the Emergence of Conventions**-->
<!---->
<!--Brian Skyrms, in his 1996 book \"Evolution of the Social Contract,\"-->
<!--offered a groundbreaking perspective on the emergence of conventions and-->
<!--the common knowledge that often accompanies them by employing the-->
<!--framework of evolutionary game theory.^9^ Skyrms demonstrated that-->
<!--conventions, including signaling systems, can arise and be sustained-->
<!--through evolutionary dynamics, such as natural selection and replicator-->
<!--dynamics, without requiring agents to be fully rational or to possess-->
<!--explicit common knowledge at the individual level.^9^ His work showed-->
<!--that even in populations of agents with limited or no cognitive-->
<!--abilities, simple evolutionary mechanisms can lead to the establishment-->
<!--of coordinated behaviors that function as conventions. For example, a-->
<!--signaling system where a particular signal consistently leads to a-->
<!--beneficial response for both the sender and the receiver can evolve-->
<!--simply because those who use the signal effectively are more successful.-->
<!---->
<!--Skyrms argued that the common knowledge frequently associated with-->
<!--conventions might be a consequence of these evolutionary processes-->
<!--rather than a necessary precondition.^49^ Over time, as a particular-->
<!--convention becomes established within a population through repeated-->
<!--interactions and the differential success of strategies, individuals-->
<!--learn to expect others to follow it. This expectation becomes-->
<!--self-reinforcing because adhering to the convention leads to positive-->
<!--outcomes, thus creating a form of shared understanding that, while it-->
<!--might not meet the strict philosophical definition of common knowledge,-->
<!--serves a similar functional purpose in facilitating coordination.-->
<!--Evolutionary game theory provides a naturalistic explanation for the-->
<!--origins of these shared expectations and coordinated behaviors,-->
<!--suggesting that they can emerge and stabilize without the need for-->
<!--infinite levels of iterated knowledge or sophisticated rational-->
<!--deliberation.-->
<!---->
<!--H. Peyton Young, in his 1998 book \"Individual Strategy and Social-->
<!--Structure,\" further explored the emergence of social norms and-->
<!--conventions through the lens of stochastic evolution in populations of-->
<!--boundedly rational agents.^51^ Young\'s models focused on how-->
<!--individuals learn and adapt their strategies based on their experience,-->
<!--often using limited information and simple learning rules, and without-->
<!--necessarily possessing common knowledge of the game or other players\'-->
<!--intentions. His work demonstrated that conventions can emerge as-->
<!--\"stochastically stable equilibria\" through a process of adaptive play,-->
<!--where agents adjust their strategies based on samples of past-->
<!--interactions, and where occasional random mistakes or experimentation-->
<!--can lead to the selection of particular conventions over others.^51^-->
<!---->
<!--Young\'s analysis suggested that the common knowledge often associated-->
<!--with established institutions and conventions might be a consequence of-->
<!--the long-run stability of these equilibria rather than a necessary-->
<!--condition for their initial formation or maintenance in a world of-->
<!--bounded rationality.^53^ As a particular convention becomes entrenched-->
<!--through adaptive play and stochastic selection, individuals come to-->
<!--expect it and rely on it in their interactions. This leads to a form of-->
<!--common understanding that supports the convention\'s stability and-->
<!--allows for predictable social interactions, even if the agents-->
<!--themselves are not engaging in sophisticated reasoning about each-->
<!--other\'s knowledge states. The aggregate effect of individual adaptive-->
<!--behavior, even without perfect rationality or complete information, can-->
<!--thus lead to the emergence of complex social structures and conventions-->
<!--that resemble the outcomes of rational strategic thinking.-->
<!---->
<!--**Cognitive Science Perspectives on Common Knowledge**-->
<!---->
<!--**Relation to Theory of Mind:**-->
<!---->
<!--The concept of common knowledge finds a significant parallel and-->
<!--connection in cognitive science with the development of Theory of Mind-->
<!--(ToM), which refers to the ability to attribute mental states -- such as-->
<!--beliefs, intentions, desires, and knowledge -- to oneself and to-->
<!--others.^1^ The foundational work of David Premack and Guy Woodruff in-->
<!--1978 explored whether non-human primates possess a ToM, raising critical-->
<!--questions about the cognitive prerequisites for understanding others\'-->
<!--mental states.^56^ Their research suggested that attributing mental-->
<!--states to others is a fundamental aspect of social cognition, and-->
<!--arguably a necessary stepping stone towards grasping the more complex,-->
<!--recursive nature of common knowledge. To understand \"I know that you-->
<!--know,\" one must first have the capacity to represent that \"you know\"-->
<!--something.-->
<!---->
<!--Michael Tomasello\'s extensive work on the evolution of human cognition,-->
<!--particularly his 2014 contributions, emphasizes the uniquely human-->
<!--ability to engage in \"shared intentionality\".^58^ This involves the-->
<!--capacity to participate with others in collaborative activities that-->
<!--have shared goals and intentions, requiring a sophisticated-->
<!--understanding of one\'s own and others\' mental states, as well as the-->
<!--ability to engage in joint attention. Shared intentionality, with its-->
<!--focus on mutual understanding and shared goals in cooperative contexts,-->
<!--bears a close relationship to the concept of common knowledge. Engaging-->
<!--in a collaborative task effectively often requires a level of shared-->
<!--understanding about the objective, the roles of the participants, and-->
<!--each other\'s intentions and expectations, which can be seen as a-->
<!--functional form of common knowledge within that specific context.-->
<!--Tomasello\'s research suggests that the development of shared-->
<!--intentionality is a key factor differentiating human cognition from that-->
<!--of other primates and underpins our complex social interactions and-->
<!--cultural practices.-->
<!---->
<!--**Experimental Studies:**-->
<!---->
<!--Experimental studies have provided valuable insights into how humans-->
<!--reason about and utilize common knowledge in various strategic and-->
<!--social situations. Michael Suk-Young Chwe\'s 2001 work, \"Rational-->
<!--Ritual,\" offered an analysis of how public rituals and ceremonies serve-->
<!--as mechanisms for creating common knowledge within a group.^1^ Chwe-->
<!--argued that by making information simultaneously available to a large-->
<!--number of people, rituals ensure that participants not only receive the-->
<!--information but also become aware that others have received the same-->
<!--information, and that those others are aware of this as well, creating a-->
<!--shared epistemic state that is crucial for solving coordination problems-->
<!--and fostering shared cultural understandings.^60^ From Super Bowl-->
<!--commercials to political inaugurations, these public events function to-->
<!--establish common knowledge by providing a shared experience and a-->
<!--simultaneous broadcast of information.-->
<!---->
<!--Cristina Bicchieri and Erte Xiao\'s 2009 experimental research focused-->
<!--on the role of expectations in individuals\' compliance with social-->
<!--norms.^18^ Their studies explored how individuals\' normative-->
<!--expectations (what they believe others think they should do) and-->
<!--empirical expectations (what they believe others will actually do)-->
<!--influence their decisions in social interactions. These expectations are-->
<!--closely related to the concept of common knowledge, as they involve-->
<!--beliefs about others\' beliefs and behaviors. Bicchieri and Xiao\'s work-->
<!--highlighted the complex interplay between these different types of-->
<!--expectations in guiding behavior, providing empirical evidence for the-->
<!--importance of shared understandings -- a key component of common-->
<!--knowledge -- in the context of social norms. By manipulating information-->
<!--about others\' expectations, their experiments shed light on the-->
<!--cognitive processes involved in reasoning about shared knowledge and its-->
<!--impact on individual choices within social contexts.-->
<!---->
<!--**Alternative Frameworks to Lewis\'s Common Knowledge**-->
<!---->
<!--**Common Belief vs. Common Knowledge:**-->
<!---->
<!--Recognizing the stringent requirements and potential limitations of-->
<!--common knowledge, particularly the infinite regress, alternative-->
<!--frameworks have been proposed to better capture the epistemic states-->
<!--underlying coordination and social interaction. One such framework is-->
<!--the concept of common belief, introduced by Dov Monderer and Dov Samet-->
<!--in 1989.^1^ Common belief relaxes the absolute certainty of common-->
<!--knowledge by focusing on a state where the probability of a proposition-->
<!--being believed by all agents, and this belief being iterated at higher-->
<!--levels, approaches one.^40^ This notion acknowledges that in many-->
<!--real-world situations, individuals might act based on a very high degree-->
<!--of confidence that others share certain beliefs, even if they cannot be-->
<!--absolutely certain of this at every level of iteration. Common belief-->
<!--provides a more flexible and potentially more realistic lens through-->
<!--which to analyze scenarios where strong mutual expectations drive-->
<!--behavior without necessarily meeting the strict criteria of common-->
<!--knowledge.-->
<!---->
<!--**Bayesian Common Priors:**-->
<!---->
<!--Another influential alternative framework is the concept of Bayesian-->
<!--common priors, developed by John Harsanyi in 1967.^31^ The common prior-->
<!--assumption posits that all rational agents\' differences in beliefs can-->
<!--be ultimately traced back to differences in the private information they-->
<!--have received, assuming they all started with the same prior probability-->
<!--distribution over the possible states of the world.^64^ This assumption-->
<!--has become a foundational element in much of Bayesian game theory and-->
<!--economics, providing a framework for analyzing how agents with different-->
<!--pieces of information update their beliefs and how these beliefs-->
<!--interact in strategic settings. The common prior assumption allows for-->
<!--the modeling of situations with asymmetric information while maintaining-->
<!--a degree of coherence in agents\' belief systems, and it provides a-->
<!--basis for understanding when and how agents might potentially converge-->
<!--in their beliefs despite having different information.-->
<!---->
<!--**Pragmatic Approaches to Shared Understanding:**-->
<!---->
<!--Pragmatic perspectives on shared understanding offer yet another way to-->
<!--think about the epistemic foundations of communication and interaction,-->
<!--moving beyond the purely logical or probabilistic frameworks of common-->
<!--knowledge and common belief. Herbert Clark\'s 1996 work on language use-->
<!--emphasized the collaborative nature of communication, where participants-->
<!--actively work to establish and maintain \"common ground\" -- the shared-->
<!--knowledge, beliefs, and assumptions that are necessary for successful-->
<!--understanding and coordination.^1^ Clark highlighted that communication-->
<!--is a dynamic process where individuals constantly monitor each other\'s-->
<!--understanding and adjust their contributions to ensure they are on the-->
<!--same page. This perspective suggests that shared understanding is often-->
<!--achieved through active collaboration and the ongoing management of-->
<!--common ground in real-time interactions.-->
<!---->
<!--Dan Sperber and Deirdre Wilson\'s 1986 relevance theory proposed that-->
<!--human communication is fundamentally driven by the principle of-->
<!--relevance.^1^ According to this theory, communicators aim to provide-->
<!--information that is most relevant to their audience in a given context,-->
<!--and audiences interpret utterances by selecting the most relevant-->
<!--interpretation. This process often relies heavily on shared background-->
<!--knowledge and inferential processes to achieve understanding-->
<!--efficiently. Relevance theory suggests that individuals do not need to-->
<!--explicitly state everything they know; instead, they rely on their-->
<!--audience to infer the intended meaning by selecting the interpretation-->
<!--that is most relevant given the context and their shared assumptions.-->
<!--This pragmatic approach underscores how shared understanding in-->
<!--communication is often achieved efficiently through inference and the-->
<!--exploitation of shared contextual assumptions, rather than requiring-->
<!--explicit common knowledge of every detail.-->
<!---->
<!--**Conclusion: Synthesis and Future Directions in Common Knowledge-->
<!--Research**-->
<!---->
<!--The concept of common knowledge, first systematically explored by David-->
<!--Lewis, has proven to be a remarkably influential and multifaceted idea-->
<!--across a range of disciplines. From its philosophical roots in-->
<!--understanding conventions and coordination, it has been formally-->
<!--integrated into game theory and economics, providing powerful tools for-->
<!--analyzing strategic interactions and information asymmetry. Evolutionary-->
<!--game theory has offered a perspective on how shared understandings, akin-->
<!--to common knowledge, can emerge and stabilize through dynamic processes-->
<!--without requiring fully rational agents or infinite levels of iterated-->
<!--knowledge. Cognitive science has linked common knowledge to fundamental-->
<!--aspects of social cognition, such as theory of mind and shared-->
<!--intentionality, and experimental studies have provided empirical-->
<!--insights into how humans reason about and utilize shared knowledge in-->
<!--various contexts.-->
<!---->
<!--Despite its theoretical significance, the standard definition of common-->
<!--knowledge, with its requirement of infinite recursion, has faced-->
<!--critiques regarding its psychological plausibility and practical-->
<!--attainability, particularly in dynamic real-world scenarios. This has-->
<!--led to the development of alternative frameworks, such as common belief,-->
<!--which relaxes the certainty requirement, and pragmatic approaches that-->
<!--focus on the active construction of shared understanding in-->
<!--communication. These alternative perspectives highlight the complexity-->
<!--of shared knowledge and the need for models that better reflect the-->
<!--cognitive limitations of agents and the imperfections of information in-->
<!--real-world interactions.-->
<!---->
<!--Future research on common knowledge and shared understanding could-->
<!--fruitfully explore several directions. Further investigation into the-->
<!--cognitive mechanisms underlying how humans actually reason about-->
<!--others\' knowledge and beliefs, and how these processes relate to the-->
<!--theoretical concept of common knowledge, is warranted. The development-->
<!--of more realistic models of strategic interaction that incorporate-->
<!--bounded rationality, imperfect information, and the dynamics of belief-->
<!--formation and revision remains a crucial area. Additionally, the-->
<!--application of common knowledge concepts and related frameworks to-->
<!--understand emerging technologies and social phenomena, such as the-->
<!--dynamics of information sharing on social media platforms and the-->
<!--challenges of coordination in artificial intelligence systems, presents-->
<!--exciting new avenues for exploration. Understanding the nuances of how-->
<!--shared knowledge and expectations are formed, maintained, and utilized-->
<!--in these evolving contexts will be increasingly important in the years-->
<!--to come.-->

<!--Schiffer conceptualized common knowledge as an *infinite hierarchy of mutual knowledge*, defined recursively as follows:  -->
<!--- **Mutual knowledge₁**: Everyone knows proposition $$ p $$.  -->
<!--- **Mutual knowledge₂**: Everyone knows that everyone knows $$ p $$.  -->
<!--- **Mutual knowledgeₙ**: This recursion continues for $$ n $$ levels, where $$ n \to \infty $$.  -->
<!---->
<!--Formally, common knowledge $C(p)$ is the infinite conjunction:  -->
<!--$$-->
<!--C(p) = \bigwedge_{n=1}^{\infty} K^n(p),-->
<!--$$  -->
<!--where $$ K^n(p) $$ denotes the $$ n $$-th level of mutual knowledge. This approach emphasizes communication as the mechanism to elevate mutual knowledge into common knowledge. For example, in the *Muddy Children Puzzle*, if two children both see mud on each other’s faces, they initially have mutual knowledge₁ (both know there’s at least one muddy face). Only after public announcements do they iteratively reach mutual knowledge₂, mutual knowledge₃, etc., converging toward common knowledge.-->
<!---->
<!--Aumann formalized common knowledge using *information partitions* over possible states of the world. Let $$ \Omega $$ be the set of possible states, and let $$ \mathcal{P}_i $$ represent the information partition of agent $$ i $$. Aumann’s framework defines common knowledge as follows:  -->
<!---->
<!--An event $$ E \subseteq \Omega $$ is *common knowledge* at state $$ \omega $$ if the cell of the *meet* of the agents’ partitions containing $$ \omega $$ is a subset of $E$.  -->
<!---->
<!--A key result is Aumann’s Agreement Theorem: If two rational agents with common priors have common knowledge of their posterior probabilities about an event $E$, their probabilities must coincide. Formally, if $$ C(p_i(E) = q_i) $$ for agents $$ i = 1, 2 $$, then $$ q_1 = q_2 $$. This framework avoids explicit infinite regress by defining common knowledge as a fixed point in the agents’ information partitions.-->

<!--Schiffer’s model aligns with intuitive examples like the Muddy Children Puzzle, where announcements progressively deepen mutual knowledge. Aumann’s approach, by contrast, provides a mathematical foundation for strategic interactions, showing how common knowledge enforces consensus among Bayesian agents. While Schiffer’s hierarchy is often seen as philosophically intuitive, Aumann’s formalism has been more widely adopted in economics and computer science due to its technical precision. Both, however, agree that common knowledge transcends mere mutual understanding, requiring agents to account for *each other’s epistemic states* in a systematic way.-->
<!---->
<!--The relationship between Lewis’s notion and these subsequent formalizations remains debated. Cubitt and Sugden [@cubitt2003] suggested a fundamental distinction between Lewis’s perspective and later theories, while Vanderschraaf [-@vanderschraaf1998] and Sillari [-@sillari2005] argued for continuity between them.-->
<!---->
<!--*** -->
<!---->
<!--Cubitt and Sugden (2003) argue for a fundamental **discontinuity** between David Lewis’s concept of common knowledge (as outlined in *Convention*, 1969) and the formalizations of Schiffer/Aumann, rooted in differing philosophical foundations and operational assumptions. Here’s a breakdown of their critique:-->
<!---->
<!--### 1. **Lewis’s Notion: Coordination-Focused and Precedent-Based**  -->
<!--Lewis defines common knowledge as arising from **salient precedents** or **coordination equilibria**, where agents:  -->
<!--- Share mutual expectations grounded in a *publicly recognized signal* (e.g., a traffic light).  -->
<!--- Do not require infinite recursion in practice; instead, common knowledge emerges from pragmatic, context-dependent reasoning.  -->
<!---->
<!--For Lewis, common knowledge is a *social construct* tied to conventions—agents coordinate because they recognize a shared basis for action, not because they explicitly compute infinite epistemic hierarchies.-->
<!---->
<!--### 2. **Schiffer/Aumann: Infinite Hierarchies vs. Partitions**  -->
<!--- **Schiffer** formalizes common knowledge as an **infinite tower** of mutual knowledge ($$ C(p) = \bigwedge_{n=1}^\infty K^n(p) $$).  -->
<!--- **Aumann** models it via **information partitions** (common knowledge as the meet of agents’ partitions in $$ \Omega $$).  -->
<!---->
<!--Both frameworks presuppose agents with unbounded logical capacity to process infinite iterations or partition intersections—a stark contrast to Lewis’s emphasis on pragmatic, bounded coordination.-->
<!---->
<!--### 3. **Key Discontinuities Highlighted by Cubitt & Sugden**  -->
<!--**(a) Epistemic vs. Practical Foundations**  -->
<!--- Lewis’s common knowledge is *action-oriented* and rooted in **conventions** (e.g., stopping at red lights).  -->
<!--- Schiffer/Aumann treat it as a *logical property* of agents’ knowledge structures, decoupled from real-world coordination.  -->
<!---->
<!--**(b) Role of Salience**  -->
<!--- Lewis requires **salient cues** (e.g., focal points) to bootstrap common knowledge.  -->
<!--- Schiffer/Aumann exclude salience, relying instead on axiomatic mutual reasoning.  -->
<!---->
<!--**(c) Bounded vs. Unbounded Rationality**  -->
<!--- Lewis’s agents operate under **bounded rationality**—common knowledge emerges from practical precedents, not recursive deductions.  -->
<!--- Schiffer/Aumann assume agents can process infinite hierarchies or partition operations, implying **unbounded cognitive capacity**.  -->
<!---->
<!--**(d) Necessity of Publicity**  -->
<!--- Lewis emphasizes **public events** (e.g., a fire alarm) as triggers for common knowledge.  -->
<!--- Schiffer/Aumann reduce publicity to abstract logical or set-theoretic constructs (e.g., public announcements as partition refinements).  -->
<!---->
<!--### 4. Implications of the Discontinuity  -->
<!--Cubitt and Sugden contend that Schiffer/Aumann’s formalisms fail to capture the **pragmatic, evolutionary nature** of common knowledge in Lewis’s work. By treating it as a fixed logical property, they neglect:  -->
<!--- The role of **culture** and **history** in establishing conventions.  -->
<!--- How agents with limited reasoning capacity *actually* achieve coordination (e.g., via salience rather than infinite deliberation).  -->
<!---->
<!--This disconnect renders Schiffer/Aumann’s models ill-suited for explaining real-world scenarios Lewis sought to address, such as language conventions or social norms.-->
<!---->
<!--### Example: The Traffic Light Puzzle  -->
<!--- **Lewis**: Drivers stop at red lights because they recognize a *salient convention* reinforced by precedent. Common knowledge arises from shared social practice, not mutual knowledge hierarchies.  -->
<!--- **Schiffer/Aumann**: Common knowledge would require drivers to know that others know they know the light is red, ad infinitum—an unrealistic demand for real-time coordination.  -->
<!---->
<!--### Conclusion  -->
<!--Cubitt and Sugden’s critique underscores that Lewis’s common knowledge is **procedural** (rooted in coordination practices), while Schiffer/Aumann’s is **declarative** (a static property of knowledge structures). This philosophical and operational gap explains why formal models struggle to replicate the dynamism of Lewis’s convention-based framework.-->
<!---->
<!--***-->
<!---->
<!--Vanderschraaf and Sillari (2009) argue for **continuity** between David Lewis’s convention-based notion of common knowledge and the formalizations of Schiffer/Aumann, positing that these frameworks share foundational goals and can be reconciled through careful interpretation. Their analysis emphasizes complementary perspectives rather than irreconcilable differences. Here’s their reasoning:-->
<!---->
<!------->
<!---->
<!--### 1. **Shared Foundational Goal: Explaining Coordination**  -->
<!--Both Lewis and the Schiffer/Aumann frameworks aim to explain how agents achieve **coordinated behavior** in strategic interactions.  -->
<!--- **Lewis**: Common knowledge arises from *conventions* (e.g., traffic rules) that stabilize expectations.  -->
<!--- **Schiffer/Aumann**: Formalize the epistemic conditions necessary for coordination (e.g., infinite mutual knowledge or partition intersections).  -->
<!---->
<!--Vanderschraaf and Sillari contend that Schiffer/Aumann’s models *operationalize* the abstract conditions Lewis presupposes in his conventions. For example, Aumann’s partitions can encode the "publicity" of events central to Lewis’s conventions, while Schiffer’s hierarchy mirrors the iterative reasoning agents use to infer shared expectations.-->
<!---->
<!------->
<!---->
<!--### 2. **Publicity as a Bridge**  -->
<!--Lewis’s emphasis on **public events** (e.g., a fire alarm) as triggers for common knowledge aligns with Schiffer/Aumann’s focus on *public announcements* or *partition refinements*:  -->
<!--- In Aumann’s model, a public event $$ E $$ corresponds to a partition cell known to all agents, which becomes common knowledge after observation.  -->
<!--- Schiffer’s hierarchy similarly requires public communication to escalate mutual knowledge.  -->
<!---->
<!--This bridges Lewis’s pragmatic notion of salience (e.g., a red traffic light) with formal models’ requirement of shared information structures.-->
<!---->
<!------->
<!---->
<!--### 3. **Bounded Rationality as Truncated Hierarchies**  -->
<!--Vanderschraaf and Sillari argue that Schiffer’s infinite hierarchy and Aumann’s partitions can accommodate **bounded rationality** in practice:  -->
<!--- Agents in real-world scenarios (e.g., Lewis’s conventions) need not compute infinite recursions explicitly. Instead, established conventions act as **focal points** that *approximate* common knowledge after a few iterations.  -->
<!--- For example, drivers stopping at a red light rely on a convention that implicitly assumes mutual knowledge up to a pragmatically sufficient level (e.g., $$ K^2(p) $$ or $$ K^3(p) $$), bypassing infinite regress.  -->
<!---->
<!--This aligns with experimental evidence showing that humans rarely reason beyond 2–3 levels of mutual knowledge in coordination games.-->
<!---->
<!------->
<!---->
<!--### 4. **Conventions as Fixed Points**  -->
<!--Lewis’s conventions can be mapped to **fixed points** in Aumann’s partition framework:  -->
<!--- A convention (e.g., “drive on the right”) corresponds to a *stable equilibrium* where agents’ knowledge partitions align with shared social rules.  -->
<!--- Similarly, Schiffer’s hierarchy converges to a fixed point ($$ C(p) $$) as mutual knowledge deepens through repeated interactions.  -->
<!---->
<!--Thus, conventions are not merely cultural artifacts but *emergent properties* of the epistemic structures formalized by Schiffer/Aumann.-->
<!---->
<!------->
<!---->
<!--### 5. **Reconciling Salience with Formal Models**  -->
<!--Vanderschraaf and Sillari reinterpret Lewis’s “salience” as a mechanism for **partition refinement** or **hierarchy truncation**:  -->
<!--- A salient event (e.g., a fireworks display) publicly signals a shared context, allowing agents to coordinate without infinite reasoning.  -->
<!--- This can be modeled in Aumann’s framework by restricting the state space $$ \Omega $$ to a subset where salience is common knowledge.  -->
<!---->
<!--For instance, in Lewis’s “phone call breakdown” example, agents coordinate on a default meeting time because salience (e.g., noon) acts as a partition-refining public signal.-->
<!---->
<!------->
<!---->
<!--### 6. **Common Knowledge as a Dynamic Process**  -->
<!--Both frameworks implicitly treat common knowledge as a **dynamic process** rather than a static state:  -->
<!--- **Lewis**: Conventions evolve through precedent and reinforcement.  -->
<!--- **Schiffer/Aumann**: Mutual knowledge escalates via announcements (Schiffer) or Bayesian updating (Aumann).  -->
<!---->
<!--This shared emphasis on iterative learning undermines Cubitt and Sugden’s “discontinuity” claim, as both traditions acknowledge that common knowledge is *constructed* through interaction.-->
<!---->
<!------->
<!---->
<!--### Example: The Repeated Traffic Light  -->
<!--- **Lewis**: Drivers stop at red lights because repeated precedent creates a convention.  -->
<!--- **Schiffer/Aumann**: Each successful coordination (stopping at red) refines drivers’ partitions or mutual knowledge, reinforcing the convention as common knowledge.  -->
<!---->
<!------->
<!---->
<!--### Conclusion  -->
<!--Vanderschraaf and Sillari’s continuity thesis hinges on three claims:  -->
<!--1. Schiffer/Aumann’s formalisms **generalize** Lewis’s conventions by specifying their epistemic preconditions.  -->
<!--2. Bounded rationality in practice **truncates** infinite hierarchies to match Lewis’s emphasis on pragmatic coordination.  -->
<!--3. Salience and publicity act as **bridges** between abstract formal models and real-world conventions.  -->
<!---->
<!--By framing Lewis’s work as a *procedural instantiation* of Schiffer/Aumann’s declarative structures, they argue that the frameworks are complementary, not contradictory.-->

## Arbitrariness and normativity
* Convention space: mapping conventions theories across two dimensions ↓
* [When and why Conventions cannot Be Social Institutions | Philosophia](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11406-019-00125-0) — 5 dimensions of conventions

@oconnor2019 draws two important distinctions: between conventions and social norms, and between more and less arbitrary conventions. First distinction means that not all behavioral regularities have normative force. For example, friends have a convention of meeting each Friday evening at a bar, and showing up is not what each of them strictly ought to do, for if someone does not come, it is fine for the rest of the friends. On the contrary, if two cars are driving on the same side of the road towards each other, the drivers are forced to swerve, for otherwise they might crash. They ought to swerve, for not only might one of them be fined but they might cause an accident. To clarify, as @bicchieri2005 points out, conventions are different from social norms in the relationship between self-interest and common interest. They coincide in the former and do not necessarily coincide in the latter. In the case of friends at a bar, there is no or little tension between selfand common interest, while in the case of driving cars there is. O'Connor stresses that conventions and norms are the poles of a continuum along which the former acquire normative force. ^60075e

The second distinction concerns the arbitrary and historically contingent nature of conventions that they “might have been otherwise”. 

<!--According to Lewis, this arbitrariness is one of the key distinguishing aspects of conventions. However, as @gilbert1992 points out in her critique of Lewis's work, not all possible solutions to a coordination problem are equally profitable for players. In cases where one way of coordinating is more preferred than another, convention will not be that arbitrary. In other words, arbitrariness is a feature of conventions that is a continuum between contingency and necessity. For example, signaling between vervet monkeys might well be modeled as a convention in the Lewisian sense of repeated behavioral patterns of solving coordination problems [cf. @harms2004; @skyrms2010]. However, this convention is not historically contingent in the sense of several possible solutions being equally profitable, for there are evolutionary constraints breaking the symmetry between multiple equilibria. Agents might be hardwired to certain strategies. This distinction, as O'Connor underlines, illuminates some conventions as more functional and others as more conventional.[^4]-->

<!--- There are many equilibrium-based theories in the social science literature, stemming from Lewis's (1969} seminal work on conventions. See, for example, Schotter (1981}, Calvert (1998}, Grief (2006}, Binmore (2010}. The account presented here is close in spirit to Aoki's (2001, 2011} and Grief and Kingston's (2011} "hybrid" theories. The use of the hawk-dove game to represent animal and human conflicts over contested resources goes back to Maynard Smith's (1982} work on evolutionary game theory. See also Sugden (1986} and more recently Gintis (2007}. On correlated equilibria see Aumann (1974, 1987}, as well as Vanderschraaf (1995, 1998, 2001} and Gintis (2007, 2009}. The theory of institutions as rules in equilibrium has been discussed in a symposium recently published in the Journal of Institutional Economics. The commentaries of Aoki (2015}, Binmore (2015}, Sugden (2015}, and Smith (2015}, in particular, address some of the issues discussed in this chapter.

<!--Bicchieri (2001) discusses in depth the problem of belief formation in coordination games. The idea that society is a gigantic coordination game and that social institutions help people find a solution is already in Hume (1748}, but has been reformulated in gametheoretic fashion by philosophers and social scientists like Lewis (1969}, Ullmann-Margalit (1977}, Schotter (1981}, Sugden (1986}, Skyrms (1996, 2004}, Binmore (1998, 2005}. Knight (1992} discusses the coordinating function of institutions, as well as the competitive aspect of games such as battle of the sexes. The puzzle of cooperation in prisoner's dilemma experiments has generated an enormous literature, but explanations based on social norms are quite common-see for instance UllmannMargalit (1977}, Sober and Wilson (1998}, Binmore (2005}, Bicchieri (2006}, Gintis (2009}. Functional explanations have suffered from a bad press in social science as a consequence of Jon Elster's (1983} influential critique. Pettit's (1996} distinction between explanations of emergence and explanations of resilience is meant to resist this critique. On equilibrium explanations, finally, see Sober (1983 -->
