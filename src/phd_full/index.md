# Глава 1. Принудительная сила институтов в социальной онтологии
В первой главе диссертации описывается проблема, — откуда исходит принудительная сила социальных институтов, а также рассматриваются её ключевые решения — традиция социальной онтологии Джона Сёрла и его последователей [@searle1995; @searle2010; @tuomela2013; @gilbert1992; @bratman2022], традиция теоретико-игрового анализа социальных конвенций Дэвида Льюиса [@lewis1969; @vanderschraaf1995; @gintis2009a], институциональной экономики [ @acemogly2005; @aoki2011; @aoki2007; @north1990], а также синтез этих традиций в унифицированной социальной онтологии правил-в-равновесии Франческо Гуалы [@guala2015; @guala2016a] и его критику [@searle2015; @rabinowicz2018; @hedoin2021; @Vanderschraaf_2017].

Результат первой главы — формулировка проблемы диссертации: способна ли синтетическая онтология Франческо Гуалы объяснить принудительную силу социальных институтов? И если нет, то как может быть устроена такая непротиворечивая синтетическая социальная онтология?

Social conventions are of major interest for social ontology, a philosophical study of the entities comprising the social world. Some scholars see them as foundational blocks of social ontology [@bickhard2008] and others use them as more primitive units to construct complex social ontologies involving the notions of *social institutions*, which are often dubbed normatively-driven sets of social conventions [@aoki2007; @hindriks2022]. For example, @guala2016 mentions that the such mundane notions as "a professor", "a student" or "a husband" make no sense without social institutions as normative structures embedding and making these roles and their content possible. It is because these notions are a part of a mostly hidden and taken-for-granted infrastructure of roles with duties and rights. And conventions, as Guala argues, hold those together. 

A good deal of the current social ontology is detached from actual social science [@sarkia2023]. It has mostly been developed within analytic philosophy [@baker2019; @searle1995; @epstein2015; @gilbert1992] and social scientific tradition of critical realism [@archer1995; @elder-vass2010]. There are views that social ontology is intrinsically more complex than any "natural" ontology for being "interactive", or dependent on beliefs of individuals and hence changeable [@hacking1999; @epstein2015] and that social reality is inherently normative, meaning it cannot be descriptive and hence cannot import methodologies from "natural" ontologies [@asta2024; @haslanger2012]. Such a position renders and justifies the importance of an "extra-scientific" study of the social world. To me, both interactivity and inherent normativity of social reality do not prevent their explanation from a naturalistic angle, which could shed light on a descriptive social ontology.

According to @epstein2018, the field of social ontology divides into two distinct inquiries. The first one deals with the constituents of social entities and addresses the question “what is the social world composed of?”. The second strand of research is concerned with the construction of social categories, or kinds, and with the question “how do social kinds like money, borders, marriage and others get established?”. Individual people constituting a social group exemplify the former inquiry and children playing a game where stuffed animals have a tea party exemplify the latter (as they have "set up" the conditions for something to be a tea party) [@epstein2015, 57].

The difference between the strands is in the metaphysical relation of individuals and social facts. In the first case, social facts supervene on the facts about individuals, meaning that social properties cannot change without changing the individual ones. In the second case, facts about individuals *set up the conditions* for something to count as a social fact, i. e. dollar bills with a particular ink and paper and collective acceptance for money [-@epstein2015, 58].

One of the most famous expressions of the latter is Searle's [-@searle1995] formula “X counts as Y in context C”. For example, “bills issued by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing (X) count as dollars (Y) in the United States (C)“ [-@searle1995, 28]. Epstein calls the former relationship (exemplified with "issued by") *grounding* and the latter one (exemplified with "counts as") *anchoring*, where grounding is responsible for *instantiation conditions* for being, for instance, money, in a particular context, and anchoring is responsible for *the mechanism of establishing instantiation conditions*. For example, in Searle's case, *collective acceptance* of the fact X is such a mechanism[^grounding]. 

[^grounding]: The Searle's formula involves both relations, grounding and anchoring, but for the sake of simplicity and to illuminate collective acceptance as a necessary condition for Searle's formula I will refer to it as to anchoring.

Such consideration exemplifies one of the two main views on the role of metaphysics[^metaphysics] in scientific inquiry. The first, empiricist one, renders metaphysics irrelevant and redundant or, if taken seriously, expects its constraints on models to impede the knowledge growth. The other view presupposes special metaphysical concepts beyond the vocabulary of science itself. For example, they discern grades of possibility and necessity largely unknown to science and go beyond causal dependence widely used in science [@ross2023].

@ross2023 suggests the distinction of *analytic* and *scientific* social ontology, where the former is derived from conceptual analyses and the latter is based on empirical investigations. For Ross, 'naturalistic metaphysics' as he calls it, does not apply transcendental concepts except those featured in theories, models or explanations of "first-order science". Ross defends what he calls 'radically naturalistic metaphysics' which is aimed at promoting scientific progress and might involve unifying or synthesising scientific discoveries.

[^metaphysics]: Metaphysics differ from ontology in that the latter is a focal set of entities in a domain which are said to exist and the former is the study of broader notions of identity, causality and the like.

Physics provides a vivid contrast for comparing scientific and analytic metaphysics. Ontology of physics is formulated in mathematical terms requiring some technical proficiency. Formulating ontology of physics in an analytic way with "possible worlds" and "propositions" would be counterintuitive and unnecessarily difficult. It would require translation of already existing scientific concepts into the language of analytic metaphysics. 

Social science and social ontology do not enjoy straightforfardness of mathematical formulations of its concepts like physics does[^mathsoc]. Instead, it invites "folk" concepts like "beliefs", "groups" and "social facts". Further divide comes from the attitude towards this ambiguity. Some scholars argue that such "folk" ontologies are sufficient [@ruben1989, @thomassen2003] and others put an interplay of "folk" and social scientific ontologies to the fore by bridging what @sellars1962 called "manifest" and "scientific" image of phenomena within their social ontological theorizing [@asta2012; @guala2016; @haslanger2018][^folk-psychology]. The ambiguity between "folk" and scientific social ontology might indeed depend on mathematical apparatus and its underdeveloped character in social science. @ross2023 also notes that ontology construction most probably will require its formulation with mathematical frameworks sensitive to structural modeling (like hierarchical Bayesian inference[^hbi]) and not set theory and similar tools from analytic metaphysics. 

[^mathsoc]: Although not widely known, there have been such attempts. See @simon1962, @fararo1978 and, most notably, @gintis2007.

[^folk-psychology]: This mirrors a longstanding debate in philosophy of mind about "folk psychology" and eliminativism, where on camp contends that "folk" concepts like beliefs and desires approximate real inner workings of the brain [#insertSource] and the other camp reduces these concepts to brain states and claims that the true inner workings can be described only in material and mechanistic terms [#insertSource].

[^hbi]: Hierarchical Bayes is a model with probabilistic parameters (meaning they are uncertain) which allows for hierarchical relations between random variables.

As already mentioned, analytic social ontology is based on conceptual analysis and claims that it is prior to social scientific methodology [@searle1995; @epstein2016; @lauer2019]. The naturalistic camp criticizes this approach as detached from actual social science [@elder-vass2007; @sarkia2023; @kincaid2024; @ross2023; @little2020]. Their focus is meta-ontological rather than ontological as they wonder what it means to ask questions about ontology of social science and what are the ways to arrive at an ontology instead of proposing or criticizing particular ontological pictures. 

Our main focus will be on Guala's "unified social ontology" [@guala2015; @hindriks2015; @guala2016] as it tries to save the "best of both worlds" from analytic and naturalistic social ontology by providing a scientifically rigorous treatment of classic analytic social ontology of Searle [-@searle1995].

In its standard formulations, which @guala2007 calls the "Standard Model of Social Ontology" (SMOSO), social ontology describes the loosely constrained individualistic foundations of social phenomena and has three key elements [@tuomela2002]:

- reflexivity
- performativity 
- collective intentionality.

Reflexivity is a property of social entities to be largely comprised of beliefs about beliefs. There are I-mode and we-mode formulations of reflexive beliefs. Some philosophers say that initial and most basic beliefs comprising “the fabric“ of the social are essentially in We-mode and are not reducible to I-mode [@tuomela2002; @gilbert1992; @schmid2023]. However, there are also more individualistic accounts of reflexive beliefs based on game theory [@guala2016; @bicchieri2005]. 

Performativity amounts to social entities needing to be continuously maintained, performed or recreated. And collective intentionality, in its turn, refers to joint directedness of multiple individuals towards a phenomenon that contributes to its constitution. Collective intentionality tends to be presented either as a derivative of common knowledge and I-beliefs of the form “everyone knows that everyone knows that P“, where P is some social fact like social norm [@bicchieri2005], or as a primitive notion which makes common knowledge redundant. Moreover, there are attempts to naturalize collective intentionality by showing its irreducibility to individual intentionality [@rakoczy2007; @gallotti2012]. 

A prominent example is Searle [-@searle1995] who asks whether it is possible to be epistemologically objective about ontologically subjective issues. How can we know the truths about things whose existence depends on our representations or feelings, for example, about money, property and marriage? By analysing these distinctions of ontology/epistemology and objectivity/subjectivity, Searle arrived at an idea of a missing ingredient that allows for a picture of ontologically subjective entities, which is *constitutive rules* of the form “X counts as Y in C”. 

Here, our classifications of the social world help establish and maintain it, whereas non-social objects are indifferent to our classifications of it, as @hacking1999 puts forward with his distinction of interactive and indifferent kinds[^kinds]. Nature's objects do not change their behaviour given these classifications of them as opposed to social objects. This idea illustrates the notions of reflexivity and performativity characteristic for the “Standard model”. If social entities are comprised of beliefs about beliefs, their nature depends on these beliefs, and if beliefs change, social entities change accordingly. If social entities depend on beliefs about them, it is needed to constantly perform those to maintain them. To do this, individuals need to have collective intentionality about these beliefs. For example, for money to be itself, a relevant community has hold a collective intention to believe that certain physical entities can be used as a medium of exchange. 

[^kinds]: This distinction mirrors the classic one of natural and social kinds, where the former are "homeostatic property clusters", sets of necessary and stable features [@boyd1991].

Along with the "Standard model", @guala2007 calls game theory one of the two main approaches to social ontology. He departs from the works of @schelling1980 and @lewis1969, claiming that the latter was the first to apply rational choice analysis to social ontology and to present social conventions as systems of self-sustaining beliefs. Schelling, before Lewis, already was aware that coordination problems are unsolvable from the pure game-theoretic perspective if the existence of focal points is admitted, for the latter need a separate explanation. Schelling advocated the supplementation of an a priori approach to game theory with empirical studies of the emergence of focal points. This point was further explicated by @sugden2006, as we saw in the previous chapter.

An intrinsic problem of application of game theory to social ontology is that there is no mechanism of spreading of high utility-bearing strategies across the population. Seen in terms of biological fitness, the most successful strategy derived from a long evolutionary history spreads across the population. In contrast, seen from the utility viewpoint, the very cause of spread a utility-bearing strategy begs an explanation. This is why Guala critiques application of game theory to social ontology and tries to modify it.

Guala strives to overcome the shortcomings of the both "Standard model" with its utter anti-realism (due to dependence on beliefs) and game theory in his own "unified social ontology", which integrates the notions of reflexivity, performativity and intentionalty with formal accounts of social conventions as objective structures underpinning the aforementioned features of the "Standard model".

@hindriks2015 propose a theory that social institutions like money, marriage or others can be seen as (sets of) conventions in Lewisian sense with added normaivity. They employ many arguments from our previous discussions like Aumann/Vanderschraaf *CE*, Skyrms/Maynard-Smith *ESS* and emphasize the role of *normative belief* in a manner similar to Bicchieri/Gintis. As we will pose a problem inside their theory later, it is important to carefully present and unpack it, which I will do in the next section.

## ⏳ 1.1 Институт как система правил: принудительная сила из коллективной интенциональности 

<details>
Теория Джона Сёрла представляет собой фундаментальный вклад в философию общества, фокусируясь на онтологии социальных институтов. Разработанная в работах от «Речевых актов» (1969) до "Создания социального мира" (2010), она объясняет, как социальная реальность конструируется через коллективную интенциональность и язык, подчеркивая роль конститутивных правил в создании институциональных фактов с принудительной силой. Принудительная сила здесь понимается как деонтические полномочия — права, обязанности и санкции, которые обязывают индивидов к определенному поведению в контексте институтов, таких как деньги, брак или государство. Эта сила не физическая, а нормативная, возникающая из коллективного признания [@searle1995]. Теория интегрирует элементы философии языка, разума и общества, предлагая унифицированный подход к пониманию, как «физические факты» (brute facts) преобразуются в «институциональные» через правила и статус-функции.

### 1.1.1 Теория конститутивных правил Джона Сёрла
Интеллектуальные корни теории Сёрла уходят в аналитическую философию середины XX века. Он опирается на идеи Дж. Остина, чья теория речевых актов ввела понятие *перформативов* — высказываний, которые «создают» реальность (например, «объявляю вас мужем и женой") [@austin1962]. Сёрл развивает это, показывая, что перформативы лежат в основе институциональных фактов [@searle1969]. Другим ключевым интеллектуальным источником идей Сёрла послужил Людвиг Витгенштейн, чьи идеи о языковых играх и правилах [@wittgenstein1953] Сёрл адаптирует для различия между регулятивными и конститутивными правилами. Витгенштейн подчеркивал, что значение возникает из использования, а Сёрл применяет это к социальным институтам, где правила не просто регулируют, но конституируют деятельность.

Влияние также заметно от Джона Ролза, чья статья "Two Concepts of Rules" [@rawls1955] ввела понятие конститутивных правил для игр вроде шахмат. Сёрл расширяет это на социальную реальность, включая принудительную силу институтов. В более широком контексте теория Сёрла повлияла на социальную онтологию, интегрируя ее с философией разума: *коллективная интенциональность* — это биологическая способность, возникшая эволюционно, что, по мнению Сёрла, связывает социальное с естественными науками [@searle2010]. В русскоязычном академическом дискурсе влияние Сёрла видно в работах по социальной философии, где его идеи адаптируются для анализа власти и институтов, подчеркивая роль языка в создании нормативных структур [@baidlaeva2014; @nikitin2019].

Теория Сёрла также перекликается с критической теорией, хотя он отвергает редукционизм марксизма или структурализма. Вместо этого он предлагает натуралистический подход: социальные факты объективны эпистемически, несмотря на их субъективную онтологию — зависимость от ментальных состояний [@searle2006].

<!--### 1.1.2 Теория и её компоненты-->
Центральным элементом теории Сёрла является различие между регулятивными и конститутивными правилами. Регулятивные правила регулируют уже существующие формы поведения (например, "не ходи по траве"), имея форму "Делай X" или "Если Y, то делай X" (Searle, 1969). Конститутивные правила, напротив, создают новые формы поведения, делая возможными институциональные факты. Их форма – "X считается Y в контексте C", где X – brute fact (например, кусок бумаги), Y – статус-функция (например, деньги), а C – институциональный контекст (например, экономическая система) (Searle, 1995).

Статус-функции — ключевой компонент: они наделяют объекты или действия функциями, не зависящими от физических свойств, а от коллективного принятия. Это создает «деонтические силы» — принудительную силу институтов, включая положительные (права, разрешения) и отрицательные (обязанности, санкции) аспекты. Например, статус "президент" наделяет индивида правом вето, обязывая других признавать это [@searle2010]. Принудительная сила здесь — нормативная: она мотивирует поведение через обязательства, возникающие из коллективной интенциональности, а не внешнего принуждения.

Коллективная интенциональность — биологически примитивная способность, позволяющая "мы-интенции" (мы делаем что-то вместе), в отличие от индивидуальной "я-интенции". Она лежит в основе социальных фактов, которые иерархически строятся: от brute facts к институциональным, с языком как необходимым средством представления статус-функций (Searle, 2006). В поздних работах Сёрл вводит "Status Function Declarations" — декларативные речевые акты, создающие реальность (например, объявление войны), подчеркивая роль языка в конституировании институтов (Searle, 2010).

В русском контексте теория адаптируется для анализа эволюции институтов: конститутивные правила объясняют, как социальные сущности, такие как власть, приобретают принудительную силу через коллективное признание (Гумницкий, 2020). Компоненты теории можно представить в таблице:

| Компонент | Описание | Пример | Роль в принудительной силе |
|-----------|----------|--------|----------------------------|
| Конститутивные правила | "X считается Y в C"; создают новые формы поведения | Кусок бумаги (X) считается деньгами (Y) в экономике (C) | Генерируют статус-функции, наделяющие деонтическими полномочиями (обязанности платить) |
| Регулятивные правила | Регулируют существующие практики | Правила этикета | Поддерживают, но не создают принудительную силу; могут эволюционировать в конститутивные |
| Статус-функции | Функции, наложенные коллективно, независимо от физических свойств | Брак как статус | Создают права и обязанности, обеспечивая принудительную силу (например, юридические обязательства) |
| Коллективная интенциональность | Примитивные "мы-интенции" | Совместная охота или выборы | Основа признания, делающего деонтические полномочия обязательными |
| Деонтические полномочия | Права, обязанности, санкции | Право собственности | Принудительная сила: мотивируют compliance через нормативные ожидания |

Searle’s social ontology distinguishes two kinds of rules: *regulative* rules, which govern actions that can occur independently, and *constitutive* rules, which create new kinds of social reality [@searle1995; @searle2010]. In Searle’s formulation, constitutive rules take the schematic form:
$$
X \text{ counts as } Y \text{ in context } C
$$
where $X$ is a pre‐institutional entity or action, $Y$ is a *status function*, a social role or function assigned to $X$, and $C$ is the relevant context or domain [@searle1995]. For example, “putting the ball in the net ($X$) counts as scoring a goal ($Y$) in a game of football ($C$)” [@searle1995]. Such rules do not merely regulate pre‐existing behavior; they *create* new social facts. In Searle’s own words, “institutional facts only exist within systems of constitutive rules” [@searle1995].

- **Constitutive vs. Regulative.** A constitutive rule makes a novel institutional action possible, whereas a regulative rule simply prescribes behavior within an already existing framework [@searle1995]. Chess provides a classic example: the constitutive rules of chess *create* the possibility of the game, whereas a regulative rule would say, for instance, “if you touch a piece you must move it” [@searle1995].
- **Status Functions and Deontic Powers.** Under a rule $X$ counts as $Y$ in $C$, $Y$ is a *status function* attached to $X$, and carrying this status typically confers normative powers (rights, obligations, etc.) on the bearer. Thus if a community collectively accepts that certain actions or objects bear status $Y$, those actions have deontic powers. Searle often emphasizes that constitutive rules imply deontic powers: e.g. a wedding ring ($X$) gives someone the status of “married person” ($Y$), along with associated rights and duties. In Searle’s framework, linguistic declarations often play a role: he introduces the idea of a *Status Function Declaration*, a speech act that imposes or announces status functions as binding [@searle2010].

Searle identifies *institutions* with systems of constitutive rules. He writes that “an institution is any system of constitutive rules of the form $X$ counts as $Y$ in $C$” [@searle1995]. Thus, for Searle, political offices, legal entities, money, marriages, etc., exist because underlying constitutive rules assign new status functions to physical or social substrates. These rules are held in place by *collective acceptance* of the community. In Searle’s view, the syntax “$X$ counts as $Y$ in $C$” – often called the *counts-as* locution – succinctly captures the logic of institutional facts.

Searle’s theory posits that social reality is built upon constitutive rules that are *creatively* implemented: they not only *regulate* behavior but *generate* the very phenomena like institutions and roles they describe [@searle1995; @searle2010].

### ⏳ 1.1.2 Последователи Сёрла: уточнение природы коллективной интенциональности
<details>
Последователи Сёрла развивают его идеи в социальной онтологии, часто уточняя или расширяя их. Раймо Туомела фокусируется на "мы-аттитюдах" (we-attitudes), интегрируя их в теорию коллективного принятия: институты возникают из совместных интенций, но Туомела подчеркивает роль норм и санкций в поддержании принудительной силы (Tuomela, 2002; 2007). Франк Хиндрикс предлагает "статусный аккаунт", ревизуя конститутивные правила: они касаются статусов с нормативными атрибутами (import), а не только "counts-as", позволяя учитывать неявные институты без явного языка (Hindriks, 2009; 2013). Брайан Эпштейн критикует, но развивает теорию, вводя "grounding" институциональных фактов в социальных практиках (Epstein, 2015).

В русском академическом пространстве последователи, такие как А.К. Байдлаева, применяют теорию к анализу власти: язык создает социальные институты с принудительной силой через перформативы, подчеркивая эволюцию от brute facts к институциональным (Байдлаева, 2014). Г.Н. Гумницкий исследует минимальные условия политики в онтологии Сёрла, фокусируясь на коллективной интенциональности как основе политических институтов (Гумницкий, 2020). М.А. Никитин связывает язык и культуру в институциональном измерении, развивая идеи о деонтических полномочиях (Никитин, 2019). Эти авторы часто интегрируют Сёрла с русской традицией социальной философии, подчеркивая роль норм в постсоветских институтах.

Другие, как Тони Лоусон, диалогизируют с Сёрлом, подчеркивая социальные тотальности вместо институциональных фактов, но признавая сходство в онтологии (Lawson, 2012). В целом, последователи расширяют теорию, добавляя акцент на неявные правила и эволюционные аспекты, делая её более гибкой для эмпирических наук.

In its standard analytic formulations, which @guala2007 even calls the "Standard Model of Social Ontology" (SMOSO), social ontology describes the loosely constrained individualistic foundations of social phenomena and has three key elements [@tuomela2002]:

- reflexivity
- performativity 
- collective intentionality.

Reflexivity is a property of social entities to be largely comprised of beliefs about beliefs. There are I-mode and we-mode formulations of reflexive beliefs. Some philosophers say that initial and most basic beliefs comprising “the fabric“ of the social are essentially in We-mode and are not reducible to I-mode [@tuomela2002; @gilbert1992; @schmid2023]. However, there are also more individualistic accounts of reflexive beliefs based on game theory [@guala2016; @bicchieri2005]. 

Performativity amounts to social entities needing to be continuously maintained, performed or recreated. And collective intentionality, in its turn, refers to joint directedness of multiple individuals towards a phenomenon that contributes to its constitution. Collective intentionality tends to be presented either as a derivative of common knowledge and I-beliefs of the form “everyone knows that everyone knows that P“, where P is some social fact like social norm [@bicchieri2005], or as a primitive notion which makes common knowledge redundant.

By analysing these distinctions of ontology/epistemology and objectivity/subjectivity, Searle arrived at an idea of a missing ingredient that allows for a picture of ontologically subjective entities, which is *constitutive rules* of the form “X counts as Y in C”. 

Here, our classifications of the social world help establish and maintain it, whereas non-social objects are indifferent to our classifications of it, as @hacking1999 puts forward with his distinction of interactive and indifferent kinds[^kinds]. Nature's objects do not change their behaviour given these classifications of them as opposed to social objects. This idea illustrates the notions of reflexivity and performativity characteristic for the “Standard model”. If social entities are comprised of beliefs about beliefs, their nature depends on these beliefs, and if beliefs change, social entities change accordingly. If social entities depend on beliefs about them, it is needed to constantly perform those to maintain them. To do this, individuals need to have collective intentionality about these beliefs. For example, for money to be itself, a relevant community has hold a collective intention to believe that certain physical entities can be used as a medium of exchange. 

[^kinds]: This distinction mirrors the classic one of natural and social kinds, where the former are "homeostatic property clusters", sets of necessary and stable features [@boyd1991].

### ⏳ 1.1.3 Критика теории Сёрла
<details>
Критика теории Сёрла многоаспектна и касается как концептуальных основ, так и применения. Энтони Гидденс аргументирует, что различие между конститутивными и регулятивными правилами искусственно: все правила имеют оба аспекта (например, правило "работники должны отмечаться в 8:00" регулирует, но конституирует бюрократию) (Giddens, 1984). Дэвид-Хиллел Рубен и Джеффри Уорнок видят в нём лишь лингвистическую особенность: действия конститутивны или регулятивны относительно описания, а не онтологически (Ruben, 1997; Warnock, 1971). Джозеф Рансделл критикует фокус на "connotation" (условиях) за счет "import" (нормативных последствий), предлагая правила "X считается Z" для интеграции норм (Ransdell, 1971).

Франк Хиндрикс указывает на проблемы в поздних работах: переоценка роли языка (институты могут существовать без явных деклараций), путаница в Status Function Declarations и игнорирование непризнанных прав (Hindriks, 2013; 2015). Филип Бюкенс предлагает альтернативу: институциональные объекты, как деньги, объясняются действиями и стимулами, без необходимости в статусе Сёрла (Buekens, 2014). Франческо Гвала критикует умозависимость: она подразумевает инфаллибилизм (нет ошибок об институтах), противореча реализму (Guala, 2010). Кроме того, теория не учитывает моральные ограничения: институты могут быть тривиальными или коррумпированными (например, расизм как институт) (Miller, 2010).

В русском контексте критика фокусируется на политике: Гумницкий отмечает, что минимальные условия (коллективная интенциональность, присвоение функций, конститутивные правила) игнорируют историческую эволюцию без явного принятия (Гумницкий, 2020). Никитин подчеркивает несовместимость с культурными контекстами, где принудительная сила возникает из неявных норм (Никитин, 2019). Общая критика: теория слишком формалистична, не объясняя эволюцию институтов из регулятивных практик (например, деньги из бартера) без коллективного акта (Atiyah, 1981).

Несмотря на критику, теория Сёрла остается влиятельной в философии науки, предлагая рамку для анализа, как социальные институты с принудительной силой возникают из коллективных практик и языка.

Hindriks [-@hindriks2005] has challenged several aspects of Searle’s constitutive-rule framework. His deconstruction focuses on the notions of *status functions* and the role of language. Broadly, Hindriks argued that Searle’s theoretical apparatus is misleading, and that a more streamlined account can be given by focusing on collective acceptance and normative powers.

- **Status Functions as Deontic Powers.** Hindriks finds the term *status function* confusing and somewhat redundant. He suggests dropping the “function” and simply treating statuses as normative powers. In his words, “we can do without the term function while retaining the term status,” instead explicating statuses directly as the bundle of deontic powers they grant [@hindriks2009]. By equating statuses with deontic powers (rights, obligations), Hindriks makes the normative dimension of institutions explicit, rather than hiding it under the metaphor of a “function” [@hindriks2009]. Indeed, Searle himself has acknowledged that “all status functions are deontic powers,” which supports Hindriks’s move toward a more direct terminology [@hindriks2009].

- **Redundancy of Status Function Declarations.** Searle’s idea of a *Status Function Declaration* – a speech act that supposedly creates or recognizes a status – is, for Hindriks, unnecessary. He argues that the two key claims Searle attributes to such declarations (that collective acceptance is necessary and sufficient for the status) are already implicit in the standard “counts-as” formulation. Once we accept that *institutional statuses require collective acceptance, and that collective acceptance alone brings them into being* (the “Collective Acceptance Principle”), the special notion of a Status Function Declaration adds nothing new [@hindriks2015]. Introducing declarations suggests without argument that only explicit speech acts can create institutions; Hindriks finds this unjustified and unhelpful. He concludes that Searle’s extra machinery (the Status Function Declaration with its “double direction of fit”) should be abandoned since it “does not add anything of value” [@hindriks2015].

- **Linguistic vs. Normative Distinction.** Hindriks also questions Searle’s emphasis on language as the source of all institutional power. In his earlier work, Hindriks has argued that the regulative/constitutive distinction is mainly a grammatical one: regulative rules are phrased with explicit imperatives or deontic terms, while constitutive rules are phrased with the “counts-as” locution, but both embed the same normative content [@hindriks2009]. Normative obligations figure explicitly in regulative rules (“Do X” / “If Y do X”), whereas constitutive rules imply those obligations without stating them overtly. Thus, the locus of normativity is not really different between the two; only the linguistic presentation is. Hindriks calls for a view of institutions that centers on *collective commitment* and acceptance of standards, rather than on linguistic declarations per se [@hindriks2009].

In sum, Hindriks dismantles Searle’s superstructure of status functions and declarations, proposing instead that we should “explicate statuses in terms of normative powers” and rely on a simpler collective-acceptance principle [@hindriks2009; @hindriks2015]. On this view, institutions are upheld by groups collectively endorsing certain rules, and the resulting normative powers of those rules are what really matters. His critique paves the way for unifying Searle’s approach with more analytical models, by translating constitutive claims into the language of regulative rules and equilibria.

## 🚧 1.2 Институт как равновесие: принудительная сила из стратегических ограничений взаимодействия
Если традиция «Стандартной модели» социальной онтологии полагает коллективную интенциональность источником нормативных сил правил, которые создают и регулируют социальный порядок (и институты в частности), то теоретико-игровая традиция в философии науки и институциональной экономике полагает таким источником *стратегическое ограничение* в ситуации взаимодействия. 

Это большая онтологическая разница: социальная устойчивость из общего понимания нормативности и из иррациональности отклонения от выгодного паттерна поведения. Первое требует коллективного принятия и распознавания конститутивного правила вида «X считается Y в контексте C», которое генерирует регулятивные правила, обязательные к следованию просто в силу того, что все заранее приняли конститутивное правило. Второе требует лишь инструментальной рациональности агентов в ситуациях выбора (хотя не всегда, как мы покажем ниже): агент выбирает действие, которое потенциально окажется для него более желательным. В этом смысле мы будем говорить о «максимизации полезности». 

Теория игр, таким образом, концептуализиует институты и социальный порядок в целом как проблему оптимизации и выбора наилучшей стратегии действии в зависимости от контекста ситуации. Подобный акцент на инструментальной рациональности часто подвергался критике как «выхолащивание нормативности» и неспособность схватить нормативное измерение социальной реальности. Однако, как мы покажем ниже, это тоже не всегда так.

Если источник социальной стабильности — это рациональность и оптимизация выбора в условиях ограничений контекста, то именно понятие *ограничения* (constraint), в рамках которого и происходит выбор, будет основным понятием для описания этой традиции.

Ниже мы кратко представим интеллектуальные истоки теоретико-игрового подхода к социальной координации, исходящие от Дэвида Юма и Томаса Гоббса, затем рассмотрим важные для нашей работы понятия теории игр, — игра, равновесие и несколько их разновидностей, выплата — а после представим аналитическую реконструкцию традиции как постепенной *эндогенизации ограничения*, в рамках которого происходит стратегический выбор. Подобная эндогенизация означает, что принуждение «встроено» в структуру стратегического взаимодействия. По нашему мнению, именно эндогенизация ограничения наиболее полно отражает суть традиции и объединяет разные направления внутри неё.

Начать стоит с того, что традиция понимания социальной координации как источника социального порядка имеет богатую историю. Аристотель обосновывал социальные конвенции человеческой природой и стремлением к *эвдемонии*, или процветанию. Он рассматривал людей как «политических животных», которые естественным образом формируют сообщества для достижения коллективного благополучия. Справедливость и добродетель, центральные элементы его этики, считались основой политического порядка. В отличие от более поздних последователей теории общественного договора, Аристотель рассматривал социальную организацию как неотъемлемую часть человеческой рациональности, а не как преднамеренное соглашение [@aristotle1998].

Томас Гоббс переосмыслил социальные конвенции как конструкции, порождаемые насильственным «естественным состоянием» человечества. Он утверждал, что самосохранение побуждает индивидов отказываться от свобод в пользу абсолютного суверена посредством общественного договора, являющегося результатом явного *соглашения* [@hobbes2016]. Таким образом, конвенции возникают из страха и рационального эгоизма, а не из врождённой общительности.

Согласно философу науки Брайану Эпштейну [@epstein2018], понятие *конвенции* впервые было явно использовано в качестве альтернативы понятию *соглашения* Пуфендорфом [-@pufendorf1673] для обозначения языка и права. Пуфендорф синтезировал идеи Гоббса с теологическим естественным правом. Соглашаясь с тем, что люди преследуют собственные интересы, он приписывал «закон социальности» божественному предписанию, требующему мирного сосуществования. Для Пуфендорфа естественное право обязывает людей создавать гражданские общества, а Бог является конечным автором социальных конвенций. Тем самым было введено моральное измерение, отсутствующее в инструменталистской системе Гоббса, предполагающее, что конвенции не только утилитарны, но и морально оправданы. Точка зрения Пуфендорфа заключалась в том, что конвенции не обязательно должны быть явно согласованы и могут существовать и функционировать без их преднамеренного создания. Эта интуиция в значительной степени сохранилась в последующей традиции.

Теория социальных конвенций Дэвида Юма [@hume2003; @hume1998] предложила новаторский подход к объяснению того, как конвенции возникают органически в результате человеческого взаимодействия, а не в результате рационального замысла или божественного предписания. Анализ Юма основывается на трёх ключевых предпосылках:

- роль обычаев в формировании поведения;
- центральная роль взаимной выгоды;
- искусственность конвенций.

Конвенции рассматриваются как *продукты коллективной привычки*, а не явного словесного соглашения. Эти компоненты составляют основу его теории, которая связывает психологию, этику и политическую философию.

Концепция Юма предполагает, что человеческое понимание возникает из чувственных впечатлений и идей, вытекающих из них. Это распространяется и на социальное поведение: конвенции возникают не из разума, а из повторяющегося опыта, формирующего привычки. Например, известный пример Юма с двумя гребцами в лодке иллюстрирует, как синхронизация возникает методом проб и ошибок, а не в результате предварительных переговоров:

> «Двое мужчин, гребущих веслами в лодке, делают это по соглашению или договоренности, хотя никогда не давали друг другу обещаний» [@hume2003].

Однако Шлиссер  утверждает, что подобная координация не подкрепляется «юмовскими конвенциями», поскольку они, по мнению самого Юма [^humean-conventions], требуют наличия *положительной социальной экстерналии*, тогда как два преступника могут эффективно покинуть место преступления [@schliesser2024]. В настоящей работе мы не будем сосредотачиваться на этом морально обусловленном понятии конвенций.

[^humean-conventions]: Как пишет @hume1998, «некоторые утверждают, что справедливость проистекает из человеческих условностей и исходит из добровольного выбора, согласия или объединения людей… если под условностью понимать чувство общего интереса — чувство, которое каждый человек испытывает в своей душе, которое он замечает в своих ближних и которое ведёт его, в согласии с другими, к общему плану или системе действий, направленных на общественную пользу, — следует признать, что в этом смысле справедливость проистекает из человеческих условностей. Ибо если допустить (что, действительно, очевидно), что конкретные последствия конкретного акта справедливости могут быть вредны как для общества, так и для отдельных лиц, то следует, что каждый человек, принимая эту добродетель, должен учитывать весь план или систему и ожидать согласия своих ближних в том же поведении. Если бы все его взгляды сводились к последствиям каждого его собственного поступка, его благожелательности и гуманности, а также “его любви к себе”, то она часто могла бы предписывать ему меры поведения, совершенно отличные от тех, которые соответствуют строгим правилам права и справедливости…». Шлиссер  отмечает, что положительная социальная экстерналия является необходимым условием для чисто «юмовской» конвенции [@schliesser2024].

Со временем повторяющиеся модели закрепляются в конвенциях, поскольку они решают практические проблемы, такие как координация труда и установление прав собственности, минимизируя при этом социальные трения. Обычай, как пишет Юм, «делает наш опыт полезным для нас», создавая стабильные ожидания относительно поведения других, даже в отсутствие формальных правил [@hume2003]. Акцент на привычке бросает вызов рационалистическим теориям, таким как теория Гоббса, показывая, как конвенции возникают, не требуя рациональности, посредством итеративных корректировок.

Юм выделяет четыре ключевые особенности конвенций:

- *взаимная выгода*: все стороны получают выгоду от соблюдения конвенции (например, синхронная гребля обеспечивает продвижение; стандартизированная валюта облегчает торговлю);
- *множество потенциальных решений*: теоретически могут работать разные решения (например, грести быстро или медленно), однако последовательность важнее конкретного выбора;
- *незапланированное соглашение*: конвенции развиваются спонтанно посредством «медленного прогресса» проб и ошибок, а не в результате преднамеренного договора;
- *взаимность*: соблюдение конвенции зависит от ожидания взаимности со стороны других, создавая самоподдерживающийся цикл доверия.

Для Юма конвенции, такие как права собственности, возникают потому, что люди признают «общий интерес» в стабилизации владения имуществом во избежание конфликтов, даже если их естественные склонности тяготеют к личной выгоде [@hume1998]. Этот прагматический подход отличает его теорию от моралистических рассуждений, рассматривающих конвенции исключительно как инструменты сдерживания человеческой предвзятости.

Юм классифицирует условности как *искусственные добродетели* — социальные конструкты, разработанные для противодействия «ограниченной щедрости» человечества. В отличие от естественных добродетелей, таких как доброжелательность, возникающих инстинктивно, условности, такие как справедливость или соблюдение обещаний, требуют культивации. Однако их искусственность не делает их произвольными. Напротив, они приобретают нормативную силу благодаря коллективному чувству: индивиды одобряют условности, способствующие социальной полезности, а неодобрение их нарушений со временем усиливает приверженность им. Этот процесс объясняет, как условности приобретают моральный вес, превращаясь в нормы, которые кажутся обязательными даже тогда, когда рациональный эгоизм может побуждать к их нарушению. Экспериментальные исследования, вдохновлённые работами Юма (а точнее — Льюиса [-@lewis2008]), подтверждают, что условности стабилизируют поведение даже при возникновении стимулов к нарушению, подчёркивая взаимодействие привычки и нормативности [@guala2010].

Теория Юма резко расходится с моделями общественного договора. В то время как Гоббс основывал конвенции на преднамеренных соглашениях, призванных предотвратить хаос или обеспечить права, Юм отвергал идею первоначального «естественного состояния», требующего таких соглашений. Вместо этого он утверждал, что конвенции возникают постепенно из жизненного опыта, что отражает его более широкий скептицизм по отношению к рационалистическим абстракциям. Его концепция также предвосхитила современную теорию игр, в частности анализ конвенций Льюиса как координационных равновесий [@lewis2008], хотя сам Юм уделял больше внимания психологическим механизмам.

Важно отметить, что подход Юма объединил описательную и нормативную области. Показав, как конвенции развиваются от практических потребностей к моральным нормам, он предложил достаточно натуралистическое объяснение социального порядка, избегающее апелляций к божественному закону или метафизической необходимости. Это согласуется с его неприятием причинно-следственной связи как чего-либо, выходящего за рамки наблюдаемой закономерности, и подкрепляет его точку зрения о том, что человеческие институты являются случайными продуктами обычаев, а не вечными истинами.

После Юма философы шотландского Просвещения утверждали, что социальный порядок является результатом взаимодействия отдельных людей, однако такой порядок не был специально задуман ими. Как писал Фергюсон [@ferguson1980], «нации натыкаются на установления, которые, действительно, являются результатом человеческой деятельности, но не воплощением какого-либо человеческого замысла». Однако впоследствии изучение конвенций на некоторое время утратило центральное место в философских дискуссиях.

Льюис возродил и операционализировал идеи Юма в теории конвенций, используя теорию игр и рассматривая конвенции как равновесия, поддерживаемые общими знаниями и прецедентами. В то время как Юм подчёркивал историческую случайность и постепенное возникновение, Льюис сформулировал более строгие критерии рациональности и взаимных ожиданий [@lewis2008]. Он рассматривал конвенции как решения проблем координации — класса проблем в теории игр (разделе математики, изучающем стратегическое поведение), — которые требуют от двух или более агентов согласования своих действий для достижения совместно оптимального результата. В следующем разделе мы кратко рассмотрим основные концепции теории игр, прежде чем вернуться к теории конвенций Льюиса, поскольку теория игр будет иметь решающее значение в оставшейся части диссертации.


### 1.2.1 Важные понятия теории игр
Теория игр — это математическая теория, используемая для анализа ситуаций стратегического взаимодействия между рациональными агентами, принимающими решения. Первоначально разработанная Джоном фон Нейманом и Оскаром Моргенштерном в их фундаментальной работе *Theory of Games and Economic Behavior* [@morgenstern1944], теория игр впоследствии эволюционировала и охватила широкий спектр приложений в экономике, биологии, политической науке и социологии [@gintis2009; @osborne2004]. Она предоставляет инструменты для изучения того, как индивиды или группы принимают решения в условиях, когда их результаты зависят не только от собственных действий, но и от действий других. Базовыми элементами теории игр являются игры, игроки, стратегии, выигрыши (выплаты) и равновесия [@zamir2013].

Стратегическая игра в теории игр определяется как формальная модель
$$
G = (N, S, P),
$$
где:

* $N$ — множество игроков;
* $S = (S_1, S_2, \dots, S_n)$ — наборы стратегий игроков, где $S_i$ обозначает множество стратегий, доступных игроку $i$;
* $P = (P_1, P_2, \dots, P_n)$ — функции выигрыша, где
  $$
  P_i : S_1 \times S_2 \times \dots \times S_n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}
  $$
  задаёт полезность игрока $i$ при заданном профиле стратегий [@myerson1991].

*Стратегия* $s_i \in S_i$ представляет собой полный план действий, которому игрок следует в любой возможной ситуации, возникающей в рамках игры. Выигрыши отражают вознаграждения, которые игроки получают в зависимости от комбинации стратегий, выбранных всеми участниками.

Одним из центральных понятий теории игр является *равновесие*, при котором ни один игрок не имеет стимула в одностороннем порядке изменять свою стратегию, учитывая стратегии других игроков. Наиболее известным понятием равновесия является *равновесие Нэша* (РН), введённое Джоном Нэшем в начале 1950-х годов [@nash1950]. Профиль стратегий $(s_1^*, s_2^*, \dots, s_n^*)$ образует равновесие Нэша, если для каждого игрока $i$ выполняется следующее условие:
$$
P_i(s_i^*, s_{-i}^*) \geq P_i(s_i, s_{-i}^*) \quad \forall s_i \in S_i.
$$

Здесь:

* $P_i$ — функция выигрыша игрока $i$;
* $s_i^*$ — стратегия, выбранная игроком $i$ в равновесии;
* $s_{-i}^*$ — профиль стратегий всех остальных игроков, кроме $i$.

Это неравенство означает, что игрок $i$ не может увеличить свой выигрыш, односторонне отклоняясь от стратегии $s_i^*$ к любой другой допустимой стратегии $s_i$.

Роберт Ауманн в 1974 году ввёл понятие *коррелированного равновесия* (КР) [@aumann1974]. Это обобщение равновесия Нэша позволяет игрокам координировать свои стратегии посредством сигналов от доверенного посредника. В отличие от равновесия Нэша, в котором игроки действуют независимо, КР допускает корреляцию стратегий через доступную обоим игрокам информацию. В рамках КР случайный сигнал рекомендует каждому игроку стратегию, и игроки следуют этой рекомендации. Формально КР удовлетворяет следующему условию:
$$
\sum_{s'*{-i}} q(s_i, s'*{-i}) \cdot \bigl[P_i(s_i, s'_{-i}) - P_i(s'*i, s'*{-i})\bigr] \geq 0
\quad \forall s_i, s'_i.
$$

Здесь:

* $q(s_i, s'*{-i})$ — вероятность того, что посредник рекомендует стратегию $s_i$ игроку $i$ и профиль стратегий $s'*{-i}$ остальным игрокам;
* $P_i(s_i, s'*{-i})$ — выигрыш игрока $i$, если он выбирает стратегию $s_i$, а остальные игроки выбирают $s'*{-i}$.

Это неравенство гарантирует, что ожидаемый выигрыш от следования рекомендации не меньше, чем ожидаемый выигрыш от отклонения от неё.

Как отмечал экономист Роджер Майерсон:

> «Если на других планетах существует разумная жизнь, то в большинстве из них коррелированное равновесие было бы открыто раньше, чем равновесие Нэша» [@solan1999].

КР может рассматриваться как более естественное понятие по сравнению с РН, поскольку его математическая простота и опора на координацию делают его более легко обнаружимым. Майерсон утверждал, что приоритет, отданный равновесию Нэша в научной традиции, мог быть результатом исторической случайности, а не отражением его фундаментальной значимости. В обществах или цивилизациях, где кооперативное поведение поощряется или широко распространены внешние посредники, КР может выступать более интуитивной отправной точкой для анализа стратегических взаимодействий.

В области эволюционной биологии Джон Мейнард Смит в 1973 году ввёл понятие *эволюционно стабильной стратегии* (ЭСС) [@maynard1973]. ЭСС — это стратегия $s^*$, устойчивая к «вторжению» мутантных стратегий, и удовлетворяющая следующему условию:
$$
P(s^*, s^*) > P(s', s^*)
\quad \text{или} \quad
\bigl[P(s^*, s^*) = P(s', s^*) \ \text{и} \ P(s^*, s') > P(s', s')\bigr].
$$

Здесь:

* $P(s^*, s^*)$ — выигрыш, когда и резидент, и захватчик используют стратегию $s^*$;
* $P(s', s^*)$ — выигрыш мутанта, использующего стратегию $s'$, против резидента, придерживающегося стратегии $s^*$.

Помимо РН, КР и ЭСС, в теории игр были разработаны и другие концепции равновесия, включая совершенное по подыграм [@selten1965], последовательное (sequential) [@kreps1982],  байесовское [@fudenberg1991], равновесие дрожащей руки [@selten1975] и другие. Эти уточнения направлены на устранение ограничений равновесия Нэша, особенно в динамических играх. В настоящей диссертации мы сосредоточимся на КР и ЭСС и немного затронем совершенное байесовское равновесие в развёрнутых играх.

Проблемы координации и кооперации фундаментальны для социальной философии со времён Гоббса [@hobbes2016], а теория игр стала незаменимым инструментом их анализа благодаря своей аналитической строгости и концептуальной ясности.

*Проблемы координации* возникают, когда индивидам или группам необходимо выбрать одно из нескольких возможных равновесий. Это создаёт неопределённость относительно того, какое решение будет реализовано. Подобные проблемы отражают ситуации, в которых все стороны выигрывают от согласованных действий, но испытывают трудности с выбором конкретного варианта.

<!--- привести пример проблемы координации в реальном мире — TODO-->

*Проблемы кооперации*, напротив, подчёркивают конфликт между индивидуальной рациональностью и коллективной выгодой: взаимная кооперация обеспечивает лучший результат для всех, однако индивидуальный эгоизм может приводить к социально неэффективным исходам. Такие проблемы часто требуют механизмов, способствующих координации или стимулирующих сотрудничество, включая социальные конвенции или процедуры отбора равновесий.

<!--- привести пример проблемы кооперации в реальном мире — TODO-->

Примерами проблем координации и кооперации служат классические игры, такие как *«Битва полов»* и *«Дилемма заключённого»*. В первой супруги координируют выбор совместного досуга, который устроил бы всех, а во второй два заключённых независимо решают, сотрудничать ли друг с другом или выдать партнёра полиции. Матрицы выигрышей этих игр представлены ниже[^payoff-matrix].

</div>

Чтобы проиллюстрировать различия между концепциями равновесия при решении проблем координации, рассмотрим игру *«Битва полов»* в рамках чистого РН, смешанного РН и КР.

В чистых стратегиях существуют два равновесия Нэша: оба игрока выбирают либо балет, либо футбол. Эти равновесия обеспечивают идеальную координацию, но по своей сути несправедливы, поскольку один игрок всегда предпочитает выбранное событие другому.

Существует также смешанное РН. Пусть муж выбирает балет с вероятностью $p$ и футбол с вероятностью $1-p$, а жена выбирает балет с вероятностью $q$ и футбол с вероятностью $1-q$. Используя принцип безразличия, согласно которому игрок рандомизирует свои стратегии таким образом, чтобы противник был безразличен к доступным стратегиям, получаем:

$$
2q = 1 - q \Rightarrow q = \frac{1}{3},
$$
$$
p = \frac{2}{3}.
$$

Таким образом, ожидаемые выигрыши обоих игроков в смешанном равновесии равны $\frac{2}{3}$.

В КР публичный сигнал (например, подбрасывание честной монеты) рекомендует обоим игрокам пойти либо на балет, либо на футбол с равной вероятностью, обеспечивая ожидаемый выигрыш $1.5$ каждому. КР помогает игрокам получать более высокие выигрыши и справедливость по сравнению как с чистым, так и со смешанным РН, используя общую случайность или коммуникацию.

Чтобы продемонстрировать, как сигнал влияет на структуру выигрышей, добавим стратегию *Следовать сигналу (follow signal, FS)*, где игроки выбирают на основе честного подбрасывания монеты (Орел = Балет, Решка = Футбол). Это легитимно, поскольку КР — это РН в расширенной игре с дополнительным набором стратегий [@gintis2009a; @gintis2009].

Таким образом, расширенная игровая матрица принимает следующий вид:

Профиль стратегий $(FS, FS)$ образует равновесие Нэша в расширенной игре, где $FS$ обозначает стратегию *следовать сигналу*. КР тем самым может быть представлено как равновесие Нэша в расширенной игре, но при этом оно лучше отражает реальные координационные механизмы.

Возвращаясь к проблемам координации, Кейлин О'Коннор различает *коррелятивные* и *комплементарные* проблемы координации [@oconnor2019] . В первых успешная координация требует выбора одинаковых действий, во вторых — различных. Например, чтобы избежать столкновения, водителям на разных полосах дороги нужно ехать по правой стороны дороги. А для того, чтобы хорошо подготовиться к вечеринке, одному нужно прибраться в квартире, а другому — заказать пиццу. В первом случае успешная координация зависит от выбора одного и того же действия, во втором — разных. Социальные конвенции служат механизмами стабилизации таких взаимодействий, формируя устойчивые ожидания и снижая неопределённость.

Теория конвенций Дэвида Льюиса, рассматриваемая в следующем разделе, предлагает систематическое объяснение того, каким образом такие координационные равновесия возникают и закрепляются.


### 1.2.2 Институт как координационное равновесие: традиция «конвенций» Дэвида Льюиса

<!--- переписать немного часть про льюиса, сказав, что Lewis discovers the minimal form of social constraint, ✔ deviation is possible but irrational и это proto-coercion. Что Conventions do not obligate — they trap — TODO-->

Интеллектуальная атмосфера, в которой создавалась работа Дэвила Льюиса "Convention", была в значительной степени сосредоточена на вопросах языка, значения и социального поведения. На формирование его теории повлиял ряд интеллектуальных направлений и философских проблем.

В середине XX века интерес к влиянию социальных практик на лингвистическое значение неуклонно возрастал, поскольку такие философы, как Уиллард Куайн [-@quine1960] и Людвиг Витгенштейн [-@wittgenstein1953], утверждали, что значение возникает из совместного употребления внутри сообщества. Витгенштейн подчёркивал, что значение языка формируется через публичное использование, а не задаётся какими-либо внутренними семантическими свойствами. Так, например, слово «игра» не имеет фиксированного определения, а получает своё значение через совокупность практик, с которыми оно связано. Продолжая эту традицию, Льюис стремился объяснить, каким образом языковые конвенции формируются, стабилизируются и сохраняются в сообществах, предложив систематическое описание их развития во времени. Концептуализируя значение как координированное поведение, Льюис заложил основания для понимания языка как социально организованной деятельности, а не как врождённой или сугубо индивидуалистической способности. Вследствие этого коммуникация опирается не на объективные значения, а на взаимные ожидания относительно употребления, что подчёркивает ключевую роль конвенций в языке [@lewis1969].

Дух времени аналитической философии 1960-х годов был связан с переосмыслением наследия логического позитивизма, который посредством формальной логики и эмпирической верификации определял значение через аналитически истинные высказывания или эмпирически проверяемые утверждения [@godfrey-smith2003]. Однако к 1960-м годам критика со стороны Куайна, Патнэма и других философов поставила под сомнение этот подход, в особенности различие между аналитическими и синтетическими истинами, где первые считались истинными в силу значения, а вторые — в силу их отношения к миру.

Куайн отвергал традиционные представления о необходимости и аналитичности, утверждая, что онтологические обязательства встроены в теории и язык [@quine1951; @quine1960; @quine1969], и подчёркивал роль эмпирических данных и прагматических соображений в формировании убеждений. Его критика аналитичности акцентировала изменяемость языка, показывая, что конвенции являются подвижными, а не фиксированными. Мысленный эксперимент Патнэма «Двойная Земля»[^twin-earth] развил эти идеи далее, отстаивая *семантический экстернализм* — позицию, согласно которой значение слов зависит от внешних фактов, а не только от ментальных состояний, — тем самым бросая вызов интерналистским теориям значения и подчёркивая роль внешних факторов в языковых практиках. В результате конвенции понимаются как зависящие от контекста и окружающей среды, выходя за рамки чисто внутренних или необходимых определений.

[^twin-earth]: На планете, почти во всём идентичной Земле, но где вода состоит не из $H_2O$, а из $XYZ$, жители используют слово «вода», однако обозначают им иное вещество. По Патнэму, этот пример показывает, что одних лишь психологических состояний недостаточно для определения значения; внешние факторы, такие как химический состав и условия усвоения, влияют на языковую референцию. Эта идея выражена в его знаменитом тезисе: «значения не находятся в голове».

Теория конвенций Льюиса стала ответом на этот интеллектуальный сдвиг, подчёркивая контингентный характер значения. Вместо того чтобы быть продиктованными какой-либо необходимостью, конвенции возникают как произвольные, но устойчивые решения проблем координации, отражая более прагматичное и гибкое понимание языкового значения и социальных практик. Даже самые строгие обычаи начинались как случайные поведенческие паттерны, которые могли бы быть иными, но усиливались с каждой итерацией. Эта перспектива глубоко укоренена в куайновском понимании языка как подверженного пересмотру, адаптации и переговорам внутри сообщества или культуры.

Ещё одной важной философской проблемой, к которой обращался Льюис, была онтология социальных правил и норм, находящаяся под сильным влиянием работ Юма. Льюис развил юмовскую идею о том, что конвенции могут возникать и сохраняться даже при отсутствии централизованного принуждения. Он утверждал, что конвенции являются самоподдерживающимися: после их установления у индивидов нет причин отклоняться от них, пока остальные продолжают им следовать. Главное расхождение с Юмом состояло в акценте на рациональности агентов как источнике такого конформизма, тогда как Юм подчёркивал роль психологической привычки.

Примером может служить развитие денег как средства обмена. Изначально в качестве валюты использовались различные объекты — скот, раковины или металлические монеты. Со временем бумажные деньги получили широкое признание не из-за внутренней ценности, а потому, что люди ожидали, что другие будут принимать их в обмене. Этот вывод впоследствии оказал влияние на теории спонтанного порядка и децентрализованных систем в политической философии и экономике, в частности у Фридриха Хайека [@hayek1973]. Объясняя конвенции как естественные результаты повторяющихся социальных взаимодействий, Льюис внёс вклад в более широкое понимание того, как нормы, институты и языковые практики могут возникать органически, без явного замысла или принуждения.

Кроме того, юмовский скептицизм в отношении морального реализма — позиции, согласно которой существуют объективные моральные нормы, — сыграл роль в формировании взгляда Льюиса на конвенции как произвольные, но устойчивые[^alexander]. Юм утверждал, что моральные различия не укоренены в объективных свойствах, а основаны на человеческих чувствах и социальной обусловленности. Аналогично Льюис настаивал, что конвенции не определяются какой-либо внутренней необходимостью, а возникают контингентно в ходе социальных практик. Например, выбор стороны дороги для движения — правой или левой — является произвольным, однако после установления он становится самоподдерживающимся, поскольку все индивиды выигрывают от соблюдения единого правила. Это отражает более широкий юмовский тезис о том, что социальный порядок возникает не из абсолютных принципов, а из разделяемых ожиданий и усвоенных форм поведения.

[^alexander]: Развитие идеи объективных, но относительных моральных норм в духе льюисовского подхода и с аналогичной строгостью представлено у Александра МакКензи [@mackenzie2007], что перекликается с концепцией «произвольных, но устойчивых» инструментальных конвенций.

Если проблемы значения, языка и конвенциональности были теми вопросами, которые Льюис стремился решить, а юмовское понимание конвенций — ресурсом аргументации, ему всё же требовался инструмент для построения этого аргумента. Таким инструментом стала теория игр [@vonneumann1944], а в особенности подход Томаса Шеллинга к стратегическому взаимодействию в играх со «смешанными мотивами» (mixed-motive games) [@schelling1980].

Теория игр предложила структурированную математическую основу для анализа стратегических взаимодействий между индивидами, понимаемыми как рациональные акторы. Обращение Льюиса к теории игр и теории принятия решений стало возможным благодаря доминирующему в то время интеллектуальному тренду. Акцент на формальных моделях и рациональном выборе обеспечивал общий язык и концептуальный аппарат для обсуждения социального поведения в различных дисциплинах, что делало обращение Льюиса к этим аналитическим инструментам естественным шагом.

Работы Шеллинга отличались от преобладавшего в теории игр акцента на играх с нулевой суммой, где всегда есть победитель и проигравший. Шеллинг показал, что реальные взаимодействия часто характеризуются «смешанными мотивами», в которых интересы участников одновременно и конфликтуют, и совпадают. Он критиковал ограничения сугубо математического анализа стратегического взаимодействия и отстаивал необходимость эмпирических исследований условий, формирующих поведение, в частности возможности коммуникации и наличия очевидных (salient) альтернатив. Этот расширенный взгляд, включающий как конфликт, так и кооперацию, охватывал именно те феномены сотрудничества и координации, которые привлекли Льюиса в контексте проблемы социальных конвенций.

Шеллинг утверждал, что конфликт и кооперация не обязательно являются противоположными силами, а тесно переплетены в стратегических взаимодействиях. Одним из его ключевых вкладов стало понятие *достоверного обязательства*, согласно которому способность заранее зафиксировать приверженность определённой стратегии может повлиять на решения оппонента [@schelling1960, p. 22]. Существенным элементом этого является *самоограничение*, когда игрок сознательно сокращает собственные возможности, чтобы усилить свою переговорную позицию.

Ещё одним важным вкладом стало понятие *фокальных точек* (также известных как *точки Шеллинга*) — решений, к которым индивиды естественным образом склоняются в координационных играх без явной коммуникации. Шеллинг продемонстрировал это в экспериментах, где участникам предлагалось выбрать место встречи в Нью-Йорке без предварительной договорённости: подавляющее большинство выбирало полдень на Центральном вокзале, несмотря на отсутствие каких-либо внутренних выигрышных преимуществ у этого места, но благодаря его культурной заметности [@schelling1960, p. 57].

В исследовании *чистых координационных игр* Шеллинг анализировал взаимодействия, в которых интересы игроков совпадают, но отсутствует коммуникация, например выбор одинаковых чисел ради вознаграждения. Участники часто сходились на очевидных вариантах, таких как число $1$, благодаря его свойству как наименьшего положительного целого [@schelling1960, p. 102]. Работы Шеллинга также уточнили концепцию равновесия Нэша, показав, каким образом фокальные точки помогают выделять устойчивые и заметные исходы среди множества равновесий Нэша [@lewis1969, p. 78]. Кроме того, применительно к конфликтным ситуациям Шеллинг ввёл понятие *«угроз, оставляющих место случаю»*, показав, что вероятностные угрозы, такие как частичная мобилизация, могут сдерживать противников эффективнее детерминированных, используя неопределённость для поддержания сдерживания [@schelling1960, p. 187].

Льюис формализовал идеи Шеллинга в теории конвенций, определив их как решения повторяющихся проблем координации, в которых агенты сходятся на фокальных точках благодаря взаимным ожиданиям [@lewis1969, p. 43]. Конвенции опираются на внешние стимулы, такие как избегание провалов координации, а не на внутренние обязательства. Льюис также подчёркивал, что сама коммуникация является координационной игрой, в которой сигналы получают значение через разделяемые конвенции [@lewis1969, p. 95].

Одной из центральных идей, заимствованных Льюисом у Шеллинга, является понятие фокальной точки, или «салентности». Он показал, что социальные конвенции возникают как фокальные точки координации. Так, во многих обществах люди ездят по одной стороне дороги не из-за внутреннего предпочтения именно этой стороны, а потому, что универсальное следование одной конвенции обеспечивает безопасность и предсказуемость. Развивая эту мысль, Льюис утверждает, что агенты выбирают наиболее «очевидную» конвенцию — ту, которая «выделяется» среди альтернатив благодаря прецеденту, явному соглашению или внутренним свойствам. Согласно Льюису, «очевидность« — это субъективная психологическая характеристика, независимая от стратегической ситуации, которая управляет возникновением и поддержанием конвенций. В частности, Льюис анализирует, как конвенции возникают (динамика — через первоначальный выбор и последующее усиление «очевидности«) и почему им следуют (статика — из-за подавляющей заметности уже существующей конвенции, формирующей ожидание конформизма). Последователи Льюиса переосмысляют и формализуют понятие «очевидности» преимущественно в эволюционном ключе [@oconnor2019; @oconnor2020; @skyrms2014; @gintis2007a].

Ещё одним важным заимствованием у Шеллинга является роль ожиданий и самопринуждения в стратегическом равновесии. Шеллинг показал, что во многих координационных сценариях после установления равновесия отклонение становится иррациональным, поскольку издержки нескоординированных действий превышают потенциальные индивидуальные выгоды. Льюис развивает эту идею, определяя конвенции как самоподдерживающиеся: индивиды следуют им не из-за внешнего принуждения, а потому, что взаимные ожидания делают отклонение затратным. Это особенно наглядно проявляется в языковых конвенциях, где использование определённых слов и грамматических структур сохраняется благодаря ожиданию, что другие будут делать то же самое.

Кроме того, льюисовское понятие *общего знания*, являющееся фундаментальным для его теории конвенций, восходит к акценту Шеллинга на взаимной осведомлённости в стратегическом взаимодействии, тесно связанному с «очевидностью». Хотя у Шеллинга отсутствовала строгая формализация, он подчёркивал ключевую роль разделяемого понимания для успешной координации. Льюис развил эту идею, утверждая, что устойчивость конвенции требует не только фактического следования ей, но и признания её ожидаемым образцом поведения внутри группы, что делает возможным поддержание конвенций в больших популяциях.

Опираясь на работы Шеллинга, Льюис смог придать исследованию конвенций теоретико-игровое основание, показав, каким образом они возникают, стабилизируются и сохраняются во времени. В то время как Шеллинг сосредотачивался на стратегических выборах в условиях конфликта и переговоров, Льюис распространил эти принципы на сферу языка, социальных норм и эпистемической координации, тем самым значительно расширив применимость игровых идей в философии и социальных науках. В результате *The Strategy of Conflict* Шеллинга остаётся одним из ключевых интеллектуальных источников *Convention* Льюиса и её долгосрочного влияния на теории социальной координации.

#### Теория конвенций Льюиса

Льюис определял социальную конвенцию как произвольный, но самоподдерживающийся поведенческий паттерн, возникающий из повторяющихся проблем координации между двумя или более игроками. Её отличительной чертой является конформизм участников по отношению к этим паттернам, поскольку они ожидают, что другие будут поступать так же, и это является *общим знанием*: каждый игрок ожидает конформизма остальных. Отклонение от конвенционального выбора действия приводит к меньшему выигрышу, поэтому у игроков нет стимулов к одностороннему отклонению. Так, если все ездят по правой стороне дороги, для каждого водителя рационально поступать так же, чтобы избежать столкновений. Льюис формулирует понятие конвенции следующим образом [@lewis1969, p. 76]:

Поведенческая регулярность $R$ в популяции $P$ в повторяющейся ситуации $S$ является конвенцией тогда и только тогда, когда:

1. Каждый член $P$ следует $R$
2. Каждый индивид ожидает, что остальные будут следовать $R$
3. Все члены имеют сходные предпочтения относительно возможных поведенческих регулярностей
4. Каждый предпочитает всеобщее следование $R$ при условии, что почти все остальные ему следуют
5. Члены популяции также предпочли бы альтернативную регулярность $R'$, при прочих равных условиях, если $R'$ и $R$ являются взаимно исключающими.

Позднее Льюис уточнил свой анализ, допуская редкие отклонения от конвенции, а Брайан Скирмс недавно ввёл понятие *квазиконвенций* как неустойчивых конвенций, основанных на концепции *грубого коррелированного равновесия* (coarse correlated equilibrium) [@skyrms2023]. Тем не менее значительная часть академической литературы по-прежнему опирается на строгую версию определения Льюиса.

Льюисовская конвенция представляет собой особый вид равновесия, называемый *координационным равновесием*, которое в общих чертах напоминает РН, но выходит за его пределы. В равновесии Нэша ни один участник не может улучшить свой результат посредством одностороннего изменения стратегии. Если отклонение строго снижает выигрыш, равновесие считается строгим. В этом смысле РН представляет собой «устойчивое состояние», в котором каждый индивид действует оптимально, принимая действия других как заданные. Однако льюисовская конвенция расширяет эту концепцию, подчёркивая коллективное предпочтение конформизма даже при наличии незначительных отклонений.

Важной особенностью льюисовского подхода является *произвольность* конвенций: $R$ является конвенцией только в том случае, если альтернативная регулярность $R'$ могла бы столь же успешно выполнять ту же функцию. Это подчёркивает, что конвенции являются контингентными решениями среди множества возможных вариантов, а не внутренне необходимыми структурами, что продолжает идеи Куайна [@quine1969], Патнэма [@putnam1975] и других.

Кроме того, Льюис ввёл понятие *общего знания* как необходимое условие конвенции, определяя факт $p$ как общее знание, если:

* все знают $p$;
* все знают, что все знают $p$;
* все знают, что все знают, что все знают $p$, и так далее.

Эта рекурсивная концепция знания стала предметом обширных обсуждений в философской и теоретико-игровой литературе. Роберт Ауманн [@aumann1976] и другие предложили формальные модели общего знания, отличающиеся от первоначального неформального подхода Льюиса.

Поскольку теория Льюиса опирается на теорию игр, рациональность играет в ней фундаментальную роль. Льюис предполагал, что агенты инструментально рациональны, то есть выбирают действия, максимизирующие ожидаемую полезность с учётом их убеждений и ожиданий относительно мира и поведения других. Хотя метафора человека как максимизирующего агента подвергалась критике [@paternotte2020a], она по-прежнему служит эвристическим ориентиром в экономической теории [@gintis2007; @gintis2013], биологии [@okasha2017; @okasha2012; @engel2008] и человеческой экологии [@mouden2012a; @sterelny2012]. Вместе с тем существуют альтернативные взгляды на необходимость рациональности для существования конвенций: Рут Милликан утверждает, что конвенции стабилизируются исключительно силой прецедента и не требуют рациональности или сознания [@millikan2022].

Льюисовская концепция конвенций объединяет поведение, убеждения, предпочтения и ожидания в рамках общего знания и рациональности для объяснения устойчивости конвенций. Каждый элемент определения играет ключевую роль:

- общее знание обеспечивает разделяемое понимание конвенции;
- предпочтение конформизма создаёт стимулы к следованию при условии кооперации других;
- рациональность направляет индивидуальный выбор в контексте общих ожиданий.

Поскольку одной из главных мотиваций анализа Льюиса была философская проблема языкового значения, он стремился показать, что язык укоренён в конвенциях, не требующих предварительного соглашения о терминах. Подобно тому как водители координируются относительно стороны движения без формального контракта, носители языка формируют конвенции употребления звуков или жестов для обозначения определённых объектов через повторяющееся взаимодействие и взаимные ожидания. Льюис рассматривал язык как систему сигналов, в которой значение возникает из конвенциональной связи между сигналами (словами, выражениями) и состояниями мира. Например, слово «кошка» конвенционально сигнализирует наличие представителя семейства кошачьих. Эта конвенция поддерживается тем, что говорящие обычно намерены говорить правду, а слушающие — доверяют этому намерению. Взаимные ожидания и опора на устойчивость связей «сигнал–значение» обеспечивают эффективную коммуникацию как форму координации.

Это привело Льюиса к различению *поведенческих* и *сигнальных* конвенций [@lewis2008, pp. 147–150]: первые координируют действия, вторые — значения в коммуникации. В качестве классического примера сигнальной конвенции Льюис приводит историю Пола Ревира и фонарей, вывешенных на колокольне Старой Северной церкви в 1775 году для предупреждения колониального ополчения о наступлении британских войск: два фонаря означали наступление с моря, один — с суши. Действия получателей сообщения различались в зависимости от полученного сигнала. Отправители и получатели координируются вокруг заранее установленного паттерна вида «если $X$, то $Y$»[^skyrms-learning].

[^skyrms-learning]: Как показал Скирмс [@skyrms2010; @skyrms2010a], такие паттерны могут формироваться динамически в повторяющихся играх: как $X$, так и $Y$ устанавливаются и распознаются методом проб и ошибок через обучение с подкреплением или другую динамику.

Для Льюиса сигнальные конвенции служат особым случаем, или подтипом, поведенческих конвенций, поскольку разделяют с ними произвольность, конформизм и статус общего знания. Отличие сигнальных конвенций состоит в том, что они включают коммуникацию и интерпретацию значения и решают проблемы координации посредством *передачи информации*. Они требуют процессов кодирования и декодирования, то есть производства и интерпретации сигналов.

Важной особенностью соотношения этих двух классов конвенций является то, что, по Льюису, сигнальные конвенции фундаментально опираются на уже существующие поведенческие конвенции и формируются под их влиянием. Например, значения слов зависят от соблюдения обеими сторонами установленных норм произношения и грамматики. Сигнальные системы часто демонстрируют вложенность, когда конкретные конвенции встроены в более широкие поведенческие регулярности. Так, поднятие руки для получения слова на собрании является сигнальной конвенцией, вложенной в более общую поведенческую конвенцию очередности высказываний [@vanderschraaf].

Существует формальное различие между поведенческими (или «общими», как их называет Льюис) и сигнальными конвенциями. В сигнальных играх игроки выступают либо в роли отправителей, либо в роли получателей: первые обладают приватной информацией о состоянии мира и посылают сигнал, вторые наблюдают сигнал и действуют на его основе. Формально это можно представить следующим образом:

1. Состояния мира: $L$ (лево) и $R$ (право)
2. Сигналы: $V_1$ и $V_2$
3. Действия: $A^L$ (действие влево) и $A^R$ (действие вправо)

<div class="table">

$$
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
& R₁ & R₂ \\
\hline
S₁ & (1,1) & (0,0) \\
\hline
S₂ & (0,0) & (1,1) \\
\hline
\end{array}
$$
<div class="caption">Сигнальная игра</div>
</div>

Если сигнал отправителя, представляющий состояние мира, корректно интерпретируется получателем, оба игрока получают выигрыш $(1, 1)$; если же кодирование или декодирование информации не удаётся, игроки получают $(0, 0)$. В рамках этого «информационного слоя» сигнальных систем существует множество вариантов — объединение сигналов, синонимия, обман и другие — которые подробно изучаются прежде всего философами биологии [@skyrms2010a; @skyrms2010; @huttegger2008; @godfrey-smith1991; @shea2018a; @martinez2019].

Философ биологии Питер Годфри-Смит уточнил модель Льюиса, различив *координацию состояние–действие* и *координацию действие–действие* [@godfrey-smith2014]:

- *состояние–действие*: сигналы сопоставляют состояния мира действиям получателя;
- *действие–действие*: сигналы синхронизируют действия агентов без обращения к внешним состояниям.

Координация действие–действие позволяет интерпретировать юмовских гребцов как сигнальную систему этого типа: ритм гребков служит императивным сигналом («Греби сейчас!»), который непосредственно координирует совместные действия, а не передаёт информацию о внешних условиях [@martinez2016]. Отсутствие экзогенного состояния сводит систему к чистой координационной игре с равновесием Нэша или координационным равновесием, где «сигнал» (ритм гребков) функционирует как самоподдерживающаяся конвенция, стабилизированная общими интересами и взаимными ожиданиями. В отличие от зависимой от состояния сигнализации, координация действие–действие ориентирована на *межличностную синхронизацию* через поведенческую обратную связь в реальном времени, демонстрируя, как коммуникация может организовывать совместное действие без репрезентативного содержания (representational content).

Парадигматический пример координации «состояние–действие» — тревожные крики мартышек-верветок, специфичные для каждого типа хищника. Существует отдельный крик при виде орла, побуждающий прятаться в траве, и другой — при виде змеи, побуждающий взбираться на дерево [@seyfarth1990]. Совпадение состояния мира, сигнала и действия образует полноценную сигнальную систему, или конвенцию.

Хотя формально поведенческие и сигнальные конвенции схожи, поскольку обе могут быть описаны как игры с игроками и выигрышами, они различаются тем, что вторые включают дополнительный «информационный слой» между участниками. И хотя сам Льюис считал сигнальные конвенции подтипом поведенческих, их взаимосвязь остаётся неоднозначной. Для Скирмса сигналы *информируют* действия, а сигнальные сети *координируют* действия, что неявно предполагает первичность сигнальных конвенций по отношению к поведенческим, а не наоборот. Более того, Скирмс выдвигает тезис о том, что сигнализация ответственна за эволюцию командной работы как таковой [@skyrms2010], что ставит под вопрос иерархию Льюиса и порождает проблему «курицы и яйца», выходящую за рамки данной диссертации.


#### 1.2.2.1 Уточнение механизма устойчивости 1: Вандершрааф и конвенция как информационная стабильность

<!--- дописать эту часть, сказав, что структурное ограничение конвенций (структура равновесия) последователи льюиса пытались натурализовать и описать его как системное свойство, а не психологическое (напомнить про юма (привычки) → льюиса (рациональность) → вандершраффа (доступная информация) и, наконец, скримса (динамика без рациональности)) — TODO-->
  <!--- Lewis: constraint = equilibrium structure-->
  <!--- Skyrms / evolutionary GT: constraint = dynamic attractor-->
  <!--- Vanderschraaf: constraint = informational stabilization-->

Теория конвенций Льюиса стала отправной точкой для исследований конвенций, и последующие авторы уточняли его теорию, порой до неузнаваемости. Существует множество уточнений, однако мы рассмотрим лишь наиболее важные для нашей темы — разработки Питера Вандершраафа и Брайана Скирмса.

Расплывчатость понятия равновесия была одной из критик теории Льюиса, и этот компонент активно разрабатывался и уточнялся. Две заметные переработки понятия конвенций представлены в виде *коррелированных равновесий* и *эволюционно стабильных стратегий*.

<!--#### Индуктивная делиберация Вандершраафа как источник «очевидности»-->

Вандершрааф [@vanderschraaf1995; @vanderschraaf1998; @vanderschraaf2001] переопределил социальные конвенции как КР через *индуктивное обучение*, рассматривая конвенции как основу достижения справедливости в смысле взаимной выгоды. Он формализовал понятие «очевидности» (salience или фокальные точки) как информационные разбиения (information partitions) и применил *правило Дирихле*[^dirichlet], чтобы показать, как агенты последовательно обновляют свои убеждения о стратегиях других, постепенно приходя к равновесию *эндогенно*, без предзаданного внешнего сигнала.

[^dirichlet]: Правило Дирихле — это байесовская процедура обновления, основанная на распределении Дирихле, используемом для моделирования вероятностей на конечном множестве дискретных исходов («распределение над распределениями»). В моделях обучения правило Дирихле обновляет вероятность, приписываемую каждому распределению, подсчитывая число случаев, когда оно приводило к определённому исходу, например вознаграждению. Эти счётчики служат параметрами распределения Дирихле, которое затем задаёт распределение вероятностей по вариантам. Формально, если вариант $j$ был вознаграждён $\gamma_j$ раз, обновлённая вероятность для варианта $j$ пропорциональна $\gamma_j$, а вектор вероятностей $\mathbf{x} = (x_1, \ldots, x_k)$ по $k$ вариантам таков, что $x_j \in (0,1)$ и $\sum_{j=1}^k x_j = 1$. Это правило отражает, как эмпирические частоты формируют вероятностные убеждения в рамках байесовского подхода.

Льюис считал координационное равновесие конвенцией, если игроки обладают общим знанием взаимных ожиданий. Вандершрааф называет это критерием взаимных ожиданий (КВО). У каждого агента есть решающая причина следовать своей части конвенции, ожидая, что другие агенты поступят так же. Льюис утверждал, что равновесие должно быть координационным, чтобы отражать идею о том, что человек, следующий конвенции, хочет, чтобы его намерение было распознано как таковое. Вандершрааф называет это критерием публичных намерений (КПН). Кроме того, с точки зрения Вандершраафа, Льюис полагал, что общее знание КВО необходимо для существования конвенции. Однако, как отмечает Вандершрааф, этого недостаточно, поскольку общее знание КВО может выполняться в любом строгом равновесии Нэша.

Согласно Вандершраафу, конвенция представляет собой профиль стратегий $\sigma^* = (\sigma_1^*, \ldots, \sigma_n^*)$, в котором каждый агент $i$ максимизирует ожидаемую полезность так, что
$\mathbb{E}[u_i(\sigma_i^*, \sigma_{-i}^*)] \geq \mathbb{E}[u_i(\sigma_i', \sigma_{-i}^*)]$
для всех альтернативных стратегий $\sigma_i' \neq \sigma_i^*$, обеспечивая устойчивость к односторонним отклонениям.

Формирование конвенций происходит не посредством когнитивно затратного рационального рассуждения, а через относительно дешёвые механизмы *индуктивного обучения*. Агенты используют динамику Дирихле для обновления убеждений о стратегиях оппонентов. Этот процесс описывает, как агенты многократно пересматривают свои убеждения, включая новые наблюдения за поведением других. *Делиберативное равновесие* определяется как фиксированная точка этой обучающей динамики, в которой убеждения агентов стабилизируются. Стабилизированные совместные убеждения и стратегии, возникающие в результате такого итеративного обновления, соответствуют тому, что Вандершрааф называет *эндогенным коррелированным равновесием* (ЭКР)[^ece]. Это КР, возникающее благодаря индуктивному обучению агентов и взаимному пересмотру убеждений, а не из внешнего корреляционного устройства, как это обычно представляется в более широкой литературе по теории игр[^choreographer]. Динамика Дирихле, приводящая к ЭКР, моделируется следующим образом:

[^ece]: Различие между «экзогенной» и «эндогенной» информацией, влияющей на выбор стратегии агента, уже присутствует у Аумана [@aumann1987]. Первый тип информации поступает из внешних сигналов, второй — из рассуждений агентов о том, как рассуждают другие. Ауман не считал это различие важным, поскольку знание экзогенности или эндогенности информации (и даже действий) агентов не способствует достижению КР. Использование Вандершраафом динамики Дирихле прояснило, как эндогенность может способствовать этому, хотя полностью внешний сигнал устранён не был.

[^choreographer]: Многие исследователи используют метафоры, подчёркивающие внешний характер КР: «посредник» и «корреляционное устройство» [@fudenberg1991], «хореограф» [@gintis2009a] и др.

$$
p_{t+1}(s_{-i}) = \frac{n_{s_{-i}} + \alpha_{s_{-i}}}{\sum_{s'*{-i}} (n*{s'*{-i}} + \alpha*{s'_{-i}})}
$$

где $n_{s_{-i}}$ обозначает наблюдаемые профили стратегий, а $\alpha_{s_{-i}}$ — априорные убеждения [@vanderschraaf2018]. Повторяющиеся взаимодействия приводят к зависимому от траектории возникновению фокальных точек, особенно в сценариях переговоров. Возникают две заметные конвенции: равное распределение благ ($x_i = \frac{1}{n}$) и эгалитарные распределения выигрышей, удовлетворяющие
$u_i(x_i) - u_i(d) = u_j(x_j) - u_j(d)$
для всех агентов $i,j$, где $d$ обозначает выигрыши при несогласии [@vanderschraaf1995].

Важной частью теории конвенций Вандершраафа является его вклад в моральную философию и теорию справедливости. Он обосновывает принципы справедливости в конвенциях, которые создают Парето-улучшения[^pareto] по сравнению с некооперативными базовыми состояниями. Справедливая конвенция $\sigma^J$ должна удовлетворять
$u_i(\sigma^J) \geq u_i(\sigma^B)$
для всех агентов $i$, где $\sigma^B$ обозначает базовое равновесие [@vanderschraaf2018].

[^pareto]: Парето-эффективность описывает состояние, в котором невозможно улучшить благосостояние какого-либо индивида, не ухудшив одновременно благосостояние хотя бы одного другого.

Это требование отвечает на возражение об уязвимости теорий справедливости, недостаточно защищающих наиболее уязвимых. Оно гарантирует, что конвенции приносят выгоду даже наименее обеспеченным участникам, создавая взаимные преимущества, стабилизирующие социальные порядки. Эта схема примиряет юмовский конвенционализм с теорией игр, демонстрируя, как справедливость возникает из повторяющихся координационных проблем, а не из абстрактных моральных принципов[^oconnor].

[^oconnor]: Иронично, что Кейлин О'Коннор  использует сходные идеи для изучения возникновения несправедливости и утверждает, что несправедливые порядки со временем усиливаются [@oconnor2019].

Как видно, понимание конвенции как КР допускает более «справедливую» координацию, даже если равновесие в чистых стратегиях отсутствует, как это было показано ранее на примере игры «Битва полов». Напомним, что ни одно из равновесий Нэша в чистых стратегиях в этой игре не является «справедливым» в том смысле, что игроки получают одинаковые выигрыши.

Эта игра имеет смешанное равновесие Нэша, в котором оба агента выбирают свои стратегии с вероятностью $\frac{2}{3}$, что даёт каждому ожидаемый выигрыш $\frac{2}{3}$. Однако это равновесие не удовлетворяет КПН и потому не является конвенцией. Тем не менее существует КР, справедливое для обоих игроков и предпочтительное по сравнению с равновесиями в чистых стратегиях. При подбрасывании честной монеты задаётся вероятностное пространство $\Omega = {H, W}$ с исходами «орёл» и «решка». У агентов есть общее информационное разбиение $\mathscr{H} = {{H}, {W}}$, а коррелированная комбинация стратегий задаётся функцией
$f: \Omega \rightarrow {A1, A2} \times {A1, A2}$,
где $f(H) = (A1, A1)$ и $f(W) = (A2, A2)$. Первый игрок получает более высокий ожидаемый выигрыш при этой комбинации, чем при любой другой стратегии, поэтому он не будет от неё отклоняться. Ожидаемый выигрыш первого игрока равен $2$, если выпадает $H$, и $1$, если выпадает $W$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& E(u_1 \circ f \mid H)=2>0=E(u_1(A2, A1)\mid H), \text{ и } \
& E(u_1 \circ f \mid W)=1>0=E(u_1(A1, A2)\mid W)
\end{aligned}
$$

То же верно и для второго игрока. Следовательно, ни один игрок не захочет отклоняться, поскольку общий ожидаемый выигрыш каждого игрока в этом равновесии равен

$$
E(u_k \circ f)=\frac{1}{2} \cdot E(u_k \circ f \mid H)+\frac{1}{2} \cdot E(u_k \circ f \mid T)=\frac{3}{2}.
$$

Это означает, что каждый игрок предпочитает ожидаемый выигрыш от $f$ выигрышу смешанного равновесия.

Для Вандершраафа конвенция — это отображение «состояний мира» в комбинации стратегий некооперативной игры [@vanderschraaf1995, 69].

<!--*Игра* $\Gamma$ — это упорядоченная тройка $(N, S, \mathbf{u})$, состоящая из следующих элементов:-->
<!---->
<!--1. Конечное множество $N = {1,2,\dots,n}$ — *множество игроков*;-->
<!--2. Для каждого игрока $k \in N$ существует конечное множество-->
<!--   $S_k = {A_{k_1}, A_{k_2}, \dots, A_{k n_k}}$ — *альтернативные чистые стратегии* игрока $k$. Декартово произведение $S = S_1 \times \dots \times S_n$ называется *множеством чистых стратегий* игры $\Gamma$;-->
<!--3. Отображение $\mathbf{u}: S \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ — *функция выигрыша* на множестве чистых стратегий. Для каждой комбинации стратегий $\mathbf{A} = (A_{1j_1}, \dots, A_{n j_n}) \in S$ выигрыш игрока $k$ задаётся $k$-й компонентой значения $\mathbf{u}$, то есть-->
<!--   $$-->
<!--   u_k(\mathbf{A}) = I_k \circ \mathbf{u}(A_{1j_1}, \dots, A_{n j_n}),-->
<!--   $$-->
<!--   где $I_k(\mathbf{x})$ проектирует $\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n$ на её $k$-ю компоненту.-->

Поскольку Вандершрааф опирается на модель Ауманна [@aumann1987], каждый игрок имеет собственное *информационное разбиение* $\mathscr{H}*k$ вероятностного пространства $\Omega$. Элементарные события на $\Omega$ называются *состояниями мира*. В каждом состоянии $\omega$ игрок $k$ знает, какой элемент $H*{kj} \in \mathscr{H}*k$ реализовался, но не знает, какое именно $\omega$. $H*{kj}$ представляет частную информацию игрока $k$ о состояниях мира. Хотя $k$ знает разбиения оппонентов, он не знает их содержания. Функция $f: \Omega \rightarrow S$ задаёт *экзогенно коррелированный $n$-кортеж стратегий*, так что в каждом состоянии мира $\omega \in \Omega$ каждый игрок $k$ выбирает комбинацию стратегий $f(\omega) = (f_1(\omega), \dots, f_n(\omega)) \in S$, коррелированную с $\omega$. Следовательно, играя $f_k(\omega)$, игрок $k$ следует *байесовской рациональности* и максимизирует ожидаемый выигрыш с учётом частной информации и ожиданий относительно оппонентов.

Ограничение измеримости на $f_k$ означает, что агент $k$ знает свою стратегию в каждом $\omega$. Это определение предполагает, что игроки обладают общим знанием структуры выигрышей, разбиений $\Omega$ и функции $f: \Omega \rightarrow S$, что необходимо для вычисления ожидаемых выигрышей и достижения коррелированного равновесия. Если игроки также обладают общим знанием байесовской рациональности, они будут следовать своим частям функции $f$, ожидая, что другие поступят так же, поскольку таким образом совместно максимизируется ожидаемая полезность.

Хотя у каждого агента $k$ есть частное информационное разбиение $\mathscr{H}*{k}$ множества $\Omega$, существует общее разбиение состояний мира — пересечение всех частных разбиений, $\mathscr{H} = \cap*{k \in N}\mathscr{H}_k$. Для каждого $\omega \in \Omega$ все агенты знают, какая ячейка $H(\omega) \in \mathscr{H}$ реализуется. Ожидаемые полезности агентов условны относительно этого общего разбиения, что отражает идею о зависимости конвенций от публично доступной информации.

Пусть заданы $\Gamma=(N, S, \mathbf{u})$, множество $\Omega$ и разбиение $\mathscr{H}$ событий, являющихся общим знанием игроков. Тогда функция $f: \Omega \rightarrow S$ является конвенцией тогда и только тогда, когда для каждого $\omega \in \Omega$ и каждого $k \in N$ функция $f_k$ является $\mathscr{H}$-измеримой и

$$
E\left(u_k \circ f \mid \mathscr{H}\right)(\omega)>E\left(u_k \circ\left(f_{-j}, g_j\right) \mid \mathscr{H}\right)(\omega)
$$

для каждого $j \in N$ и любой $\mathscr{H}$-измеримой функции $g_j: \Omega \rightarrow S_j$.

Это означает, что если любой игрок $j$ отклонится от конвенции $f$, каждый игрок $k \in N$, включая самого $j$, окажется в худшем положении. Такое определение конвенции как строгого коррелированного равновесия удовлетворяет критерию публичных намерений (PIC), поскольку *все агенты осведомлены об общем разбиении и ожидаемых стратегиях*. Если оппоненты ошибочно полагают, что игрок $k$ выберет стратегию $g_k(\omega) \neq f_k(\omega)$, у них может возникнуть стимул к отклонению, что ухудшит результат для $k$. Напротив, знание того, что $k$ будет играть $f_k(\omega)$ в каждом состоянии мира $\omega \in \Omega$, создаёт сильный стимул придерживаться конвенции $f(\omega)$.

Вклад Вандершраафа состоит в формализации салентности: он использует *общее* информационное разбиение $\mathscr{H}$ как необходимое ограничение, согласующее определение конвенции с духом теории Льюиса. Остаётся вопрос о происхождении самой салентности. Льюис предполагал, что предыгровая коммуникация, прецеденты и сигналы среды позволяют агентам связывать ожидания и действия с различными «состояниями мира», достигая равновесия. Однако такие источники сталкиваются с проблемой бесконечного регресса, поскольку неясно, как они могли возникнуть без уже существующих конвенциональных правил. Вандершрааф совместно со Скирмсом [@vanderschraaf1993] предложили *индуктивную делиберацию* как механизм формирования салентности. Она *требует условности от агентов* и действует через *рекурсивную модификацию убеждений*: игроки могут достичь коррелированного равновесия без коммуникации, динамически обновляя свои убеждения по общему индуктивному правилу, даже если исходные убеждения не допускают равновесия.

Байесовская рациональность, динамическое обновление и способность к рекурсивным убеждениям выступают здесь характеристиками определённой *когнитивной архитектуры* агента — описания когнитивных способностей, влияющих на поведение.

Ещё одно значительное расширение теории Льюиса связано с переопределением конвенций как ЭСС и в основном обязано Скирмсу.

#### 1.2.2.2 Уточнение механизма устойчивости 2: Скирмс и конвенция как динамический аттрактор

Скирмс поместил теорию конвенций Льюиса в эволюционную рамку. Он показал, как сигнальные конвенции могут возникать естественным образом в процессе адаптивной эволюции и обучения агентов с ограниченными когнитивными способностями, что позволяет обойтись без зависимости Льюиса от общего знания [@skyrms2010].

Хотя Скирмс фактически создал целую исследовательскую программу с многочисленными последователями [@huttegger2007a; @huttegger2007; @oconnor2020; @lacroix2020; @franke2014], и мы позже рассмотрим его обобщение моделей сигнализации Льюиса, стоит отметить, что он вряд ли сделал бы это без своей ранней, менее известной работы по теории игр, связанной с обобщением концепции ЭСС.

ЭСС, сформулированная Джоном Мейнардом Смитом и Робертом Прайсом [@smith1973], — это стратегия, которая, если её примет большинство популяции, не может быть вытеснена никакой мутантной стратегией. Ключевым является предположение *случайного распределения пар*[^pairing], когда индивиды встречаются для стратегических взаимодействий независимо от своих типов, так что вероятность встретить любую стратегию пропорциональна её частоте в популяции. Хотя это упрощает анализ и даёт элегантные теоретические результаты, оно ограничивает применимость ЭСС к смешанным популяциям и не отражает сложности структурированных взаимодействий.

[^pairing]: Случайное распределение пар — стандартное предположение в эволюционной теории игр, когда индивиды в большой хорошо смешанной популяции объединяются для взаимодействий случайным образом, т.е. каждый имеет равные шансы встретить любого другого, независимо от его стратегии. В этом контексте ЭСС зависит исключительно от средних выигрышей, определяемых частотами стратегий в популяции, и такие стратегии, как кооперация, обычно не могут сохраниться, если они напрямую не поддерживаются структурой выплат. Отклонения от случайного распределения (ассоциативные или структурированные пары) вводят корреляции между стратегиями, что принципиально меняет, какие типы поведения могут быть эволюционно стабильными [@jensen2018; @izquierdo2024].

Скирмс ослабил допущение случайного распределения пар и признал, что ЭСС не генерирует *устойчивые* стратегии при неслучайных парах, возникающих, например, через селекцию по родственникам, сигнальные системы, пространственные или социальные структуры. Эти корреляции создают зависимости взаимодействий, увеличивая вероятность встреч с аналогичной стратегией. Такие зависимости кардинально изменяют эволюционную динамику и могут стабилизировать стратегии, такие как кооперация или сигнальные конвенции, которые были бы нестабильны при классических ЭСС [@skyrms1994].

Это привело Скирмса к введению понятия адаптивно ратифицируемой стратегии — расширения эволюционно стабильной стратегии (ЭСС), которое учитывает, что структура взаимодействий в популяции может формироваться эндогенно, а не быть случайной. Благодаря этому концепт лучше предсказывает реальные эволюционные исходы.

Стратегия считается адаптивно ратифицируемой, если она даёт наибольшую ожидаемую приспособленность в ситуации, когда почти вся популяция уже её использует — с учётом того, что вероятность встретить разные стратегии может зависеть от корреляций в поведении. Иначе говоря, важно не только то, как стратегия работает против случайного оппонента, но и то, что носители схожих стратегий чаще взаимодействуют друг с другом.

Это обеспечивает динамическую устойчивость при репликаторной динамике: даже если появляются мутанты, они не получают систематического преимущества, потому что структура контактов уже «поддерживает» доминирующую стратегию [@skyrms1994].

Понятие адаптивно ратифицируемой стратегии позволило Скирмсу ввести ещё одно понятие — *коррелированная конвенция* [@skyrms2014]. Это стабильные, но не обязательно Парето-оптимальные паттерны поведения, возможные благодаря *любым зависимостям* взаимодействий между агентами. Скирмс исследовал множество источников таких корреляций: пространственные взаимодействия [@alexander1999], социальные структуры [@skyrms2003], социальные сети [@skyrms2004] и сигнальные системы [@skyrms2010a].

Подход Скирмса к конвенциям отличается от Льюиса тем, что он не опирается на общее знание, заменяя его динамическим давлением эволюции или обучения. Это давление обеспечивает возникновение и сохранение конвенций. Он показал, что даже простейшие организмы, такие как бактерии, могут приходить к сигнальным системам, аналогичным конвенциям Льюиса, с помощью простых адаптивных механизмов, таких как мутация-селекция или обучение с подкреплением (reinforcement learning, RL) [@skyrms2014].

Скирмс исследовал различные динамики обучения, которые позволяют сигнальным системам возникать в популяциях. Например:

- Простое обучение с подкреплением, когда агенты корректируют стратегии на основе проб и ошибок, опираясь на успешные взаимодействия. В базовой игре Льюиса-Скирмса с 2 состояниями мира, 2 сигналами и 2 действиями отправители и получатели начинают со случайных предрасположенностей и постепенно усиливают успешные комбинации состояний, сигналов и действий [@skyrms2010a].

- Динамика «Win-Stay/Lose-Shift», где конвенции формируются быстрее, чем при простом RL. Агент сохраняет успешную стратегию и отказывается от неудачной, что ускоряет сходимость и повышает стабильность [@skyrms2014].

Фреймворк Скирмса моделирует конвенции как стабильные равновесия игр «отправитель–получатель», которые развиваются через RL и эволюционную динамику, а не рациональное размышление. Формально, сигнальная игра включает:

- множество состояний мира $S = {s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_n}$
- множество сигналов $M = {m_1, m_2, \ldots, m_k}$
- множество действий $A = {a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_l}$.

Отправитель наблюдает состояние $s \in S$ и выбирает сигнал $m \in M$. Получатель, получив $m$, выбирает действие $a \in A$. Выплаты $u_S(s, m, a)$ и $u_R(s, m, a)$ для отправителя и получателя зависят от того, насколько хорошо действие получателя соответствует состоянию. В отличие от модели Льюиса, которая предполагает общее знание значимости для координации на уникальном равновесии, Скирмс показывает, что конвенции могут возникать через адаптивные процессы даже при случайных начальных стратегиях и отсутствии фокусных точек. Стоит заметить, что здесь также не нужны критерии Вандершраафа — взаимные ожидания и публичные намерения. *Равновесия, которые можно описать как коррелированные (поскольку есть источник корреляции в виде пространственной, сетевой или сигнальной структуры), возникают динамически*. Это ключевая мысль для данного исследования и нашей собственной теоретической разработки.

Центральным понятием в анализе Скирмса является *информационное содержание сигналов*, которое он количественно оценивает с помощью информационно-теоретических мер. Для априорного распределения вероятностей состояний $P(S_i)$ и апостериорного распределения, обусловленного сигналом $m$, $P(S_i \mid m)$, информация, передаваемая сигналом $m$, выражается как вектор отношений правдоподобия:

$$
\left( \log_2 \frac{P(S_1 \mid m)}{P(S_1)}, \log_2 \frac{P(S_2 \mid m)}{P(S_2)}, \ldots, \log_2 \frac{P(S_n \mid m)}{P(S_n)} \right),
$$

где $P(S_i)$ — априорная вероятность состояния, а $P(S_i \mid m)$ — апостериорная вероятность, обусловленная сигналом. Эта формализация связывает концептуальную рамку Льюиса с математическими моделями информации и коммуникации и показывает, как сигнал обновляет условную стратегию получателя в зависимости от состояния мира, направляя выбор действия [@skyrms2010].

Скирмс также исследует равновесия сигнальных систем при частичном совпадении или конфликте интересов между отправителем и получателем. В таких случаях равновесие может включать обманные или частично информативные сигналы. Формально, если функция выплат отправителя $u_S$ отличается от функции выплат получателя $u_R$, концепция равновесия расширяется до сигнальных равновесий, где стратегии $\sigma_S: S \to \Delta(M)$ и $\sigma_R: M \to \Delta(A)$ удовлетворяют взаимным наилучшим ответам:

$$
\sigma_S(s) \in \arg\max_{m \in M} \mathbb{E}*{a \sim \sigma_R(m)}[u_S(s, m, a)], \quad \sigma_R(m) \in \arg\max*{a \in A} \mathbb{E}_{s \sim P(\cdot \mid m)}[u_R(s, m, a)],
$$

где $\Delta(X)$ — множество вероятностных распределений по $X$ [@skyrms1996].

Эволюционную динамику, которая приводит к возникновению конвенций, часто моделируют с помощью алгоритмов обучения с подкреплением (RL), таких как модель Рота-Эрева [@erev1998]. Агенты поддерживают *склонности* (propensities) $q_i(x)$ к выбору действий $x$ (сигналов или ответов), которые обновляются итеративно в зависимости от полученных выплат:

$$
q_{i}^{t+1}(x) = q_{i}^t(x) + \alpha \cdot \left( r_i^t(x) - q_i^t(x) \right),
$$

где $\alpha$ — скорость обучения, а $r_i^t(x)$ — вознаграждение за действие $x$ в момент времени $t$ [@skyrms2010]. При многократных взаимодействиях такая динамика обучения приводит к конвергенции на стабильные сигнальные конвенции без необходимости явной координации или рационального предвидения.

Передача информации через сигналы и акцент на *информационном содержании* сигнала вызвали жаркие дискуссии в философии биологии, критикующие Скирмса за отсутствие причинно-следственной связи [@shea2018a; @godfrey-smith2020; @harms2004] и чрезмерную опору на статистические, а не функциональные связи.

Интересная часть расширения Скирмсом игры сигнализации Льюиса — это *неявная опора на эпистемический язык*: «наблюдать» состояния мира и «интерпретировать» сигналы для «обновления убеждений». Хотя Скирмс полностью отвергает байесовское толкование своих сигнальных игр [@lacroix2020a], его иногда интерпретируют как привнесшего эпистемологию в своих агентов, особенно при сравнении с теориями ментального содержания [@millikan1987; @millikan2004; @baraghith2019; @harms2004]: отправители «представляют» состояния мира и передают это публичное представление получателю, который затем «интерпретирует» его через свои собственные ментальные состояния. Например, уже упоминавшиеся тревожные сигналы мартышек-верветок: они могут быть описаны как включающие ментальные состояния, где «представляется» орёл и передаётся сигнал другим мартышкам, которые «декодируют» это представление и выбирают соответствующее действие. Хотя это правдоподобно для большинства натуралистических теорий ментального содержания [@millikan2004, @papineau2003], это не верно для Скирмса.

Хотя структура игры Льюиса-Скирмса отражает поток информации в эпистемических контекстах (состояние → сигнал → действие), и возникает соблазн рассматривать отправителей и получателей как байсовских агентов с убеждениями, *агенты Скирмса обновляют свои поведенческие предрасположенности*, а не убеждения, так как не обладают способностью к выводу и могут лишь корректировать свои отображения на основе частоты неудач [@skyrms2012].

Система «отправитель–получатель» Скирмса — это *информационный канал*, сосредоточенный на том, как возникают и стабилизируются эффективные коды (связки сигнал–значение), а не на убеждениях или намерениях агентов. Его сигнальные игры механистичны, как у Мейнарда Смита: учитываются только объективные («онтические») характеристики агентов, такие как частота стратегий в популяции или, в случае сигнальной игры, *отображения* состояния в сигнал и сигнала в действие в соответствии с частотой координационных сбоев.

Сравним игру Льюиса-Скирмса:

$$
\text{World} \xrightarrow{state} \text{Sender} \xrightarrow{Message} \text{Receiver} \xrightarrow{act}
$$

с каналом информации по Шеннону:

$$
\text{Source} \xrightarrow{original , message} \text{Encoder} \xrightarrow{signal} \text{Channel} \xrightarrow{signal} \text{Decoder} \xrightarrow{decoded , message}
$$

Философ биологии Маноло Мартинез  предлагает «channel-first» подход к сигнальным играм и утверждает, что центральной поведенческой единицей игры Льюиса-Скирмса является не стратегия, а *пара кодирования-декодирования*, что аналогично вышеупомянутым отображениям [@martinez2019].

В этой рамке состояния мира, сигналы и действия могут быть представлены как случайные величины $S$, $M$ и $A$, каждая из которых состоит из дискретных элементов, например состояний, сообщений и действий $[S_1, \dots, S_s]$, с вероятностным распределением $[Pr(S_1), \dots Pr(S_s)]$ по ним. То же самое относится к сообщениям и действиям.

Отправитель наблюдает текущее состояние и передаёт сигнал — один из $M$ возможных. Получатель получает сигнал и выбирает действие $A_i$ из множества доступных действий. И сигнал, и выбранное действие являются случайными величинами.

Вероятности этих случайных величин связаны через стратегии отправителя и получателя, которые представлены матрицами вероятностей: сигналы, условные на состояния мира, и действия, условные на сигналы.

Критикуя Скирмса, Мартинез отмечает, что тот не углубился в информационную теорию и анализировал информацию только *после того, как стратегии были приняты*, что не объясняет как агенты пришли к этим стратегиям. Мартинез предлагает использовать *функцию скорости–искажения Шеннона* [@shannon1948], чтобы показать минимальную *взаимную информацию* между состояниями и действиями при минимальном уровне искажения. Это позволяет интерпретировать выплаты как показатели искажения в канале. С этой точки зрения, координационная игра сигнализации, даже включающая обман, воспринимается как более кооперативная информационная структура.

В целом, расширение Скирмсом теории конвенций Льюиса отказалось от требований рациональности и ввело более натуралистическое описание сигнальных систем в широком контексте. Ключевое: оно подразумевает минимальную когнитивную архитектуру (или её отсутствие), что кардинально отличается от условных агентов Вандершраафа.

### 1.2.3 Институт как равновесие с модификаторами выплат 1: социальные нормы как слабое принуждение

#### 1.2.3.1 Теория социальных норм Гинтиса

Влиятельная равновесная концепция социальной стабильности, которая, однако, не опирается на идеи Дэвида Льюиса, принадлежит Герберту Гинтису. Он предложил *многоуровневую эволюционную модель* социальных норм, интегрирующую идеи теории игр, поведенческой экономики, эволюционной биологии и теории сложных систем. Гинтис утверждал, что *нормы — это форма социально передаваемого правила поведения*, которое коэволюционировала с человеческой способностью к сотрудничеству и наказанию, а их устойчивость объясняется через *коэволюцию генов и культуры* [@gintis2003; @gintis2009].

Гинтис определял социальную норму как правило поведения, которое:

1. Всеобще разделяется в группе,
2. Индивидуально интернализуется, так что отклонение вызывает отрицательные эмоции, такие как вина или стыд,
3. Принудительно поддерживается через наказание третьей стороны, и
4. Обременительно для индивидов, но адаптивно на уровне группы [@gintis2003, pp. 259–260].

Эволюционная жизнеспособность таких норм возникает из взаимодействия *индивидуальной приспособленности и группового отбора*: хотя следование нормам может быть затратным для отдельных индивидов, группы с высокой приверженностью нормам — особенно нормам сотрудничества, справедливости или наказания — превосходят менее сплочённые группы в межгрупповой конкуренции. Это формализуется в моделях *многоуровневого отбора*, где внутри группы динамика благоприятствует эгоизму, а между группами — сотрудничеству, опосредованному нормами. 

Как отмечает Влерик [@vlerick2019], решения координационных проблем возникают из внутригрупповой динамики, тогда как решения проблем с конфликтом преимущественно формируются через межгрупповую конкуренцию. Внутригрупповые процессы объясняют появление заметных координационных правил. Для решения конкуренции, однако, ключевую роль играют межгрупповые процессы: они выбирают *игровые нормы*, которые изменяют выплаты для доступных стратегий через наказания или награды, решая проблему «безбилетников» и создавая лучшие равновесия, чем те, что были доступны изначально. Это означает, что социальные нормы изменяют матрицы выплат так, чтобы *стратегии, ориентированные на собственный интерес, совпадали с интересами группы*, без необходимости самопожертвования. Они формируются взаимодействием между индивидами и между группами: последние выбирают эффективные равновесия, первые — «очевидные» (salient). Санкции применяются для решения проблем конфликта интересов.

Гинтис моделирует поддержание и стабильность норм через *репликаторную динамику* и игры на общественные блага. Пусть $x_i$ — доля индивидов, использующих стратегию $i$ (например, сотрудничество, дефект, наказание). Пусть $f_i$ — приспособленность (ожидаемый выигрыш) стратегии $i$. Уравнение репликатора:

$$
\dot{x}_i = x_i(f_i - \bar{f}),
$$

где $\bar{f} = \sum_j x_j f_j$ — средняя приспособленность в популяции. Норма устойчива, когда стратегия, которую она кодирует, становится *эволюционно устойчивой* (то есть ЭСС) благодаря своей *адаптивной выгоде на уровне группы*.

Особенность норм в подходе Гинтиса — включение *сильной взаимности*, поведенческой черты, характеризующейся *сотрудничеством с другими и наказанием несотрудничающих*, даже с личными затратами. Сильная взаимность наблюдается эмпирически в межкультурных экспериментах (игры на доверие, ультиматум, игры на общественные блага) и противоречит прогнозам моделей, основанных исключительно на эгоизме [@gintis2005]. Гинтис рассматривает эту черту не как аномалию, а как *эволюционно устойчивый поведенческий фенотип*, поддерживаемый через социализацию, основанную на нормах, и групповой отбор.

Центральная и новаторская идея Гинтиса заключается в том, что социальные нормы трансформируют не только индивидуальные *предпочтения*, но и *структуру самого стратегического взаимодействия*, изменяя субъективные представления агентов о выплатах и действиях. Эта трансформация кодируется в так называемой *матрице убеждений*, отображающей, как агенты воспринимают и оценивают свои стратегические варианты с учётом социальных норм [@gintis2009, ch. 12; @gintis2003, pp. 266–268].

В классической теории игр игра определяется как:

* множество игроков $N$,
* множество стратегий $S_i$ для каждого игрока $i \in N$,
* функция полезности $u_i: S \to \mathbb{R}$, задающая выплаты.

Гинтис утверждает, что эта схема неполна для моделирования нормоподчинённого поведения, так как предполагает, что агенты оценивают стратегии на основе статических функций полезности. Социальные нормы, однако, *вызывают эндогенные изменения функций полезности*, через социально усвоенные ожидания, эмоции (вина, стыд) и репутационные стимулы. Это отражается через *модифицированную функцию выплат*:

$$
u'_i(s) = u_i(s) + n_i(s),
$$

где $u'_i$ — норма-корректированная полезность, а $n_i(s)$ кодирует нормативные оценки профиля стратегии $s$. Функция $n_i$ зависит от убеждений агента $i$ о том, что ожидается, что является правильным или наказуемым, — формируя часть матрицы убеждений.

*Матрица убеждений* — это не просто список убеждений, а *когнитивная структура*: она кодирует, как игроки *трансформируют исходную игру* в игру, насыщенную нормами. Например, в дилемме заключённого, если оба игрока считают взаимное предательство морально неправильным и потенциально репутационно опасным, их матрица выплат *эндогенно преобразуется* в координационную игру или даже в «Охоту на оленя», в зависимости от силы нормативных убеждений.

Для формализации пусть $M$ — исходная матрица выплат, а $B$ — матрица убеждений, которая преобразует социальные ожидания, наказания и награды в численные модификаторы. Тогда:

$$
M' = M + B
$$

где $M'$ — нормо-управляемая игра, фактически воспринимаемая и реализуемая игроками.

<!--Эта идея близка к общей теории Гинтиса о **«сильно эндогенных играх»** [@gintis2009, pp. 187–189], где предпочтения и выплаты не фиксированы, а формируются культурным и институциональным контекстом. Здесь **социальные нормы действуют как приоритеты или фильтры**, которые перераспределяют игру. Матрица убеждений $B$ может эволюционировать со временем через культурную передачу, образование или обратную связь от повторяющихся игр.-->

Таким образом, Гинтис предлагает механизм внедрения норм в стратегическое поведение, связывая рациональную структуру теории игр с эволюционной и культурной психологией. Подход Гинтиса резко отличается от статических или экзогенных моделей норм, таких как конвенции Льюиса, и сближает его с конструктивистскими и динамическими традициями в поведенческой экономике.

Теория Гинтиса рассматривает нормы как культурно передаваемые и биологически обоснованные механизмы, поддерживающие масштабное сотрудничество. В отличие от теорий равновесия или основанных на ожиданиях, его модель встраивает соблюдение норм в коэволюцию генов и культуры и объясняет их устойчивость через многоуровневый отбор.

Для нас наиболее важно, что Гинтис явно вводит механизм, делающий стабилизацию игровых равновесий эндогенным. У Льюиса, Вандершраафа и Скирмса структурное ограничение равновесия — это системное свойство информации, среды или эволюционной динамики. Гинтиса также пытается встроить норму как результат биологической и культурной эволюции, однако норма сама по себе у него являет собой уже готовый механизм стабилизации. У традиции Льюиса равновесия ограничены ожиданиями, информацией или динамикой, а у Гинтиса — социальной нормой, уже интернализованной индивидом. Именно эта норма, а точнее, общее знание о ней и модифицируют матрицу игры, делая отклонение от равновесия нерациональным.

Теория Гинтиса — это попытка ответить на обвинения теории игр в выхолащивании нормативности. Иначе говоря, для Гинтиса принудительная сила исходит из двух источников: (1) эволюционно- и культурно-сформированной и передаваемой социальной нормы, которая регулирует поведение, (2) делая отклонение нерациональным по внутренним причинам (стыд, вина). Однако, по нашему мнению, социальная норма в концепции Гинтиса онтологически важнее равновесия, поскольку является условием его возможности.

#### 1.2.3.2 Социальные нормы как ожидаемые санкции в теории Кристины Биккиери

Философ Кристина Биккиери  предложила самостоятельный и ныне ставший мейнстримным *эпистемический и психологический подход* к социальным нормам, отходящий от традиционных моделей теории игр, функционалистских и чисто поведенческих объяснений [@bicchieri2005]. Она проводит различие между конвенциями и социальными нормами на основе идеи *условных предпочтений*. Согласно Биккиери, индивиды следуют правилу, если они:

(a) ожидают, что достаточно многие другие будут ему следовать (*эмпирическое ожидание*);
(b) верят, что достаточно многие другие считают, что они *должны* ему следовать (*нормативное ожидание*).

В льюисовских конвенциях значимы только эмпирические ожидания, тогда как нормативные ожидания и потенциальные санкции отсутствуют. Напротив, реальные нормы зависят от *обоих* уровней ожиданий и поддерживаются социальными санкциями — внешними (наказания) или внутренними (чувство вины) [@bicchieri2006, pp. 11–13]. Подход Биккиери подчёркивает, что изменение убеждений агентов относительно установок других может превратить конвенцию в норму, предоставляя практически значимые выводы для публичной политики и институционального дизайна.

Биккиери утверждает, что поведенческое правило $R$ является социальной нормой в популяции $P$ относительно ситуации $S$, если выполняются следующие условия:

1. Правило $R$ *распознаётся* как применимое в ситуации $S$.
2. Достаточно большая часть $P$ следует $R$ в $S$, и каждый индивид $i \in P$ имеет *эмпирическое ожидание*, что другие следуют $R$ в $S$.
3. Каждый $i \in P$ верит, что другие считают, что он *должен* следовать $R$ в $S$ (то есть обладает *нормативными ожиданиями*).
4. Каждый $i \in P$ предпочитает следовать $R$ *при условии*, что:

   * (a) он верит, что другие следуют $R$ в $S$;
   * (b) он верит, что другие верят, что он должен следовать $R$ в $S$.

Это часто выражается через *предпочтение, условное по отношению к ожиданиям*:

$$
i \text{ prefers to do } R \text{ in } S \iff EE_i(R) \land NE_i(R)
$$

где:

* $EE_i(R)$ — эмпирическое ожидание: «другие будут делать $R$ в $S$»;
* $NE_i(R)$ — нормативное ожидание: «другие ожидают, что я буду делать $R$ в $S$».

Такая условность принципиально отличает Биккиери от моделей рационального выбора и равновесных подходов. Для неё соблюдение норм зависит не от фиксированных функций полезности, а от *контекстно-зависимых сдвигов предпочтений*, обусловленных структурой убеждений.

В противовес Льюису Биккиери настаивает, что *нормы не сводимы к равновесным стратегиям* или к взаимно ожидаемому поведению. Они включают предписывающий слой — представление о том, что другие считают, что *следует* делать. Более того, в отличие от Льюиса, она не требует общего знания регулярности: нормы могут существовать в смешанных популяциях и активироваться локально [@bicchieri2006, pp. 41–45].

Биккиери утверждает, что соблюдение норм в значительной степени ситуативно и зависит от структуры ожиданий, а не от глубокой интернализации ценностей или длительного морального воспитания, подобного *self-command* в смежных с теорией игр подходах [@elster1989]. Экспериментальные данные показывают, что многие индивиды являются *условными кооператорами*, чувствительными к воспринимаемым ожиданиям, и склонными к *стратегическому уклонению от норм*, когда нормативный контекст ослаблен [@bicchieri2006, pp. 153–156]. В её модели нормы не требуют полной интернализации: они высоко контекстуальны и могут соблюдаться инструментально в соответствующих ситуациях.

По сравнению с классической теорией социальных норм Ульманн-Маргалит , которая концептуализировала нормы прежде всего как решения повторяющихся социальных проблем — координации, кооперации и предотвращения конфликтов — и рассматривала их как функциональные образования [@ullmann-margalit1977], подход Биккиери расходится с этим в двух отношениях:

1. Биккиери разрывает связь между возникновением нормы и функциональной необходимостью: не все нормы решают проблемы, и некоторые сохраняются, даже будучи субоптимальными.
2. Она выстраивает *эпистемическую модель снизу вверх*: норма существует не потому, что она решает координационную задачу, а потому что агенты *верят*, что она существует, и соответствующим образом условливают свои предпочтения. Тем самым существование нормы является *психологическим фактом о сетях убеждений*, а не просто системным решением.

Таким образом, Биккиери предлагает модель норм как *контекстуально активируемых сценариев*, укоренённых в микроуровневых эпистемических структурах и способных объяснить вариативность, хрупкость и быстрые изменения социального поведения. Важно также отметить, что агенты Биккиери полностью условны: они формируют, имеют и обновляют явные убеждения и обладают *когнитивными схемами*, достаточными для обработки этих убеждений [@bicchieri2018].

### 1.2.4 Равновесие с модификатором выплаты 2: сильное принуждение с $\delta$-параметрами

В широком спектре институциональных теорий — от новой институциональной экономики до исторической политэкономии — институты трактуются как устойчивые паттерны стратегического поведения, поддерживаемые не только ожиданиями, но и механизмами исполнения. В отличие от нормативных и эпистемических подходов к социальным нормам вроде Биккиери и Гинтиса, данные теории фокусируются не на том, *почему агенты считают некоторое поведение обязательным*, а на том, *почему отклонение от равновесия становится невыгодным*.

Общая интуиция этих подходов — что институт существует постольку, поскольку он трансформирует исходную стратегическую ситуацию, уменьшая привлекательность отклоняющихся стратегий. Формально это может быть представлено как вычитание из выигрыша отклонения некоторой величины $\delta > 0$, интерпретируемой как санкция, издержка или потеря будущих возможностей. Важно подчеркнуть, что в данных теориях *эндогенны не предпочтения и не нормы*, а именно *структуры санкций*, возникающие из повторяющихся взаимодействий, репутационных эффектов, организационных форм или материальной инфраструктуры.

#### 1.2.4.1 Авнер Грейф: межвременные санкции и институциональная связность

В работах Авнера Грейфа институты анализируются как равновесия в повторяющихся и взаимосвязанных играх, где устойчивость поведения обеспечивается через *репутационные и коллективные санкции* [@greif2006]. Классический пример — торговые коалиции магрибских купцов, где нарушение контракта в одной сделке приводит к потере доступа к сети взаимодействий в будущем.

Формально Грейф моделирует ситуацию как повторяющуюся игру с неполной информацией, где ожидаемая полезность стратегии $s_i$ для агента $i$ имеет вид:

$$
U_i(s_i) = \sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \beta^t \mathbb{E}[\pi_i(s_i, s_{-i})] - \delta_i(s_i)
$$

где $\delta_i(s_i)$ отражает ожидаемые потери от репутационных санкций. Ключевой момент состоит в том, что $\delta_i$ не задана экзогенно: она возникает из плотности и связности торговой сети, из способности агентов распространять информацию и координировать наказания.

В отличие от нормативных теорий, у Грейфа не требуется, чтобы агенты считали нарушение *морально неправильным*. Достаточно того, что санкции статистически надёжно следуют за отклонением. Институты у Грейфа — это равновесия, стабилизированные *межвременной связностью санкций*, а не интернализированными нормами.

#### 1.2.4.2 Дуглас Норт: институты как структуры стимулов и ограничений

Дуглас Норт предлагает более абстрактное, но концептуально совместимое понимание институтов как «правил игры», которые структурируют стимулы и ограничения человеческого взаимодействия [@north1990]. Он различает формальные институты (законы, контракты, бюрократические процедуры) и неформальные (обычаи, традиции, нормы), однако в обоих случаях центральным остаётся вопрос принуждения.

Для Норта институт изменяет стратегическое пространство, если он:

1. увеличивает издержки отклонения;
2. повышает предсказуемость санкций;
3. снижает трансакционные издержки исполнения.

Хотя Норт не формализует эту идею, сделать это можно было бы как изменение функции выплат:
$$
\pi_i'(s) = \pi_i(s) - \delta_i(s)
$$
где $\delta_i(s)$ определяется институциональной средой, а не субъективными убеждениями агента. Хотя Норт признаёт роль идеологий и убеждений, они выступают скорее как *факторы, влияющие на эффективность принуждения*, чем как конститутивные элементы института.

В этом смысле Норт радикально расходится с традицией Льюиса: институты у него не редуцируются к равновесиям ожиданий, поскольку без материальных и организационных механизмов санкционирования равновесие остаётся хрупким и локальным.

#### 1.2.4.3 Элинор Остром: эндогенные санкции и локальная устойчивость

Элинор Остром предлагает анализ институтов коллективного управления, показывая, что устойчивые режимы возможны и без централизованного государства [@ostrom1990]. Однако вопреки популярным интерпретациям, её теория не является нормативной в строгом смысле.

Остром подчёркивает роль:

* мониторинга,
* градуированных санкций,
* повторяемости взаимодействий,
* локальных правил применения наказаний.

Санкции у Остром эндогенны в том смысле, что они возникают из структуры взаимодействий и распределения информации, а не из абстрактных норм. Даже если участники артикулируют нормативные основания правил, устойчивость режима зависит от того, насколько санкции реально применяются и насколько они предсказуемы.

Формально её подход можно представить как локальное равновесие в повторяющейся игре с вероятностным мониторингом:

$$
\mathbb{E}[\pi_i(\text{deviate})] = \pi_i - p \cdot \delta
$$

где $p$ — вероятность обнаружения отклонения, а $\delta$ — величина санкции. Институт стабилен, если ожидаемые потери превышают выигрыш от отклонения.

В традиции, восходящей к Шеллингу, Льюису, Вандершрафу и Скирмсу, социальные институты и конвенции трактуются как равновесия ожиданий или популяционной динамики, возникающие в координационных играх [@lewis1969; @vanderschraaf1998; @skyrms2010]. Ключевым механизмом здесь является *взаимная согласованность ожиданий* или фактическая приспособленность стратегии (у Скирмса), а не санкции.

У Льюиса конвенция — это регулярность поведения $R$, такая что:

1. все ожидают, что другие будут следовать $R$;
2. у всех есть причина следовать $R$, если другие следуют $R$;
3. эта структура является общим знанием.

Формально это равновесие Нэша в координационной игре без наказаний за отклонение. Санкции, если они и присутствуют, являются *внешними* по отношению к самой конвенции.

Именно здесь возникает разрыв с подходами Грейфа, Норта и Остром: в условиях конкуренции, конфликта интересов и асимметричной информации равновесия ожиданий оказываются недостаточными для устойчивости. Без $\delta$-санкции такие равновесия либо локальны, либо чрезвычайно хрупки.

#### Промежуточный вывод

Таким образом, институциональные теории Грейфа, Норта и Остром предлагают альтернативу как нормативным, так и чисто координационным моделям. В них институты понимаются как равновесия, стабилизированные *эндогенно возникающими санкционными структурами*, а не разделяемыми нормами или общим знанием. Это позволяет аналитически отделить вопрос происхождения мотивации от вопроса устойчивости равновесия и подготовить почву для формализации институциональной стабильности через параметр $\delta$.


### 1.2.5 Критика традиции: выхолащивание нормативности и экономический империализм
<details>
Common knowledge denotes an epistemic state within a group wherein a proposition *p* is known by all members, and each member knows that every other member knows *p*, recursively extending to an infinite level of iterated knowledge. This recursive nature differentiates it from mutual knowledge, which necessitates only that each individual knows *p*. Consequently, common knowledge represents an idealized, stringent condition profoundly impacting coordination and strategic interaction, prompting investigation into its feasibility and real-world relevance.

As @cubitt2003 underline, Lewis’s initial conception of common knowledge did not imply unconstrained cognitive capacity of idealized agents. As they put forward, a proposition *p* is common knowledge if a state of affairs *A* exists where everyone has a reason to believe *A* holds, *A* indicates to everyone that everyone has a reason to believe *A* holds, and *A* indicates to everyone that *p*. This definition generates an infinite chain of “reasons to believe” rather than an infinite chain of “knowledge” as justified true belief suggesting a more pragmatic approach towards achieving coordination. This approach acknowledges the limitations of human epistemic capabilities and focuses on the justification for beliefs about states of affairs and others’ beliefs about them rather than in absolute certainty on every level of iterated knowledge. Nevertheless, the majority of scholars interpret Lewisian conventions as computationally and cognitively demanding. 

@gilbert1992 criticized the infinite regress of Lewis's common knowledge. She challenged the psychologically implausible requirement of infinite levels of iterated knowledge, arguing it is unnecessary for explaining social phenomena like collective belief and convention. Gilbert proposed a framework centered on joint commitment, asserting that social facts emerge from situations where individuals are collectively committed to intend or believe something as a unified body, rather than through an infinite chain of individual beliefs about others’ beliefs. This joint commitment involves a shared intention or belief held by a group as a collective entity, irrespective of individual members’ personal convictions—for instance, a group’s shared commitment despite private doubts. This approach provides a means to understand shared social states and collective actions, generating shared obligations and expectations that drive behavior and shape attitudes, thereby avoiding the demanding epistemic requirements of common knowledge.

@bicchieri1993 argued that real-world agents operate under bounded rationality, which is more psychologically plausible. Individuals possess finite processing capacity and memory, which makes an infinite regress of knowledge untenable. Bicchieri investigated how agents form beliefs and expectations about others’ actions in coordination games, emphasizing mutual expectations and the potential for coordination through learning and repeated interactions, even without full common knowledge. She highlighted the role of *social norms*, proposing that they function through conditional preferences – individuals preferring to conform if they expect others to do so – and normative expectations, which are beliefs about what others believe one ought to do. This allows coordination to emerge and persist through observation, belief updating, and conformity, irrespective of the norm’s common knowledge status.

@heifetz1999 underscored the limitations of the common knowledge assumption in dynamic settings and games with temporal imprecision where communication is not instantaneous or unreliable. The coordinated attack problem when two parties agree to attack at the same time exemplifies how the absence of guaranteed, instantaneous communication can preclude the establishment of common knowledge, leading to suboptimal outcomes. Researchers have investigated alternative, weaker notions like finite levels of mutual knowledge or common belief to account for imperfections in real-world information and bounded rationality, offering potentially more accurate models of coordination and cooperation.

One of the more radical criticisms of the common knowledge requirement comes from evolutionary game theory, a branch of game theory pioneered by @maynardsmith1982 which assumes natural selection and evolutionary dynamics as a source of solutions for strategic games instead of rationality of self-interested actors with complete information. These criticisms doubt the necessity of common knowledge for conventions.

For example, @binmore2008 challenged the infinite levels of common knowledge posited by Lewis, arguing that agents only require first-order expectations regarding others’ behavior to converge on an equilibrium. This perspective emphasizes accurate prediction of actions as a critical element for coordination, with rational players responding accordingly. Binmore’s evolutionary approach highlighted cultural evolution’s role in shaping these common understandings and norms, suggesting societies develop and transmit effective coordination strategies over time based on promoting social stability, a dynamic process which refines coordination strategies rather than a static, pre-existing condition of full common knowledge. He also noted that Lewis's analysis of conventions confines its usage to small-scale societies as it implies observing public events being observed by another party. And this is not realistic in larger populations. Binmore suggested that conventions do not generally require common knowledge overall and can be established in evolutionary environments with only one level of reasoning instead of infinite hierarchy of beliefs. He also notes that everyday conventions mostly operate via automatic behavior and low-level mutual expectations. 

@guala2020 put forward a similar argument about "belief-less" coordination where most everyday conventions do not require iterated beliefs and hence cognitive capacities for meta-representation. Means-ends rationality and cheap heuristics are said to be sufficient[^state-of-play].

[^state-of-play]: A quite important clarification here is that to be "on the same page" about the need of common knowledge and the degree of rationality, we need to take into account the stage of a convention in question: is it just forming or is it already stable? It seems intuitive to suggest that earlier rounds of play require more explicit beliefs and cognitive demands than later rounds when strategies become more automatic and probabilities of actions of others are easier to predict. It is less costly to converge on an equilibrium in later rounds of play, so we need to be explicit about the state of play when discussing the need for common knowledge and cognitive demands of conventions.

## 1.3 Синтез и его амбивалентность: теория «правил-в-равновесии» Франческо Гуалы
Описывается теория правил-в-равновесии (ПвР) Франческо Гуалы, её критика со стороны коллег, а также критика автора, направленная на лакуны в аргументации и, следовательно, нелегитимные теоретические выводы ПвР.

### 1.3.1 Теория правил-в-равновесии

Философы Франческо Гуала и Фрэнк Хиндрикс предлагают синтез правило-ориентированных и теоретико-игровых подходов к институтам [@guala2015]. Они называют его теорией правил-в-равновесии и говорят, что он может служить унифицированной социальной онтологией. 

В этой теории регулятивные правила находятся в координационных равновесиях, символически репрезентированных теоретическими терминами вроде «денег» или «брака» [@hindriks2015]. Эта теория соединяет подходы, основанные на регулятивных правилах, равновесиях стратегических игр и конститутивных правилах. Первые два являются взаимодополняющими и составляют собственно правила‑в‑равновесии, а третий дополняет его, предоставляя символическую репрезентацию.

*Подход, основанный на правилах* — это экономические теории, которые мы рассматривали выше. В них правила направляют и ограничивают поведение в социальном взаимодействии. Они — «человечески созданные ограничения» социальных взаимодействий [@north1990]. В социологии традиция трактовки институтов как правил восходит к классикам вроде Макса Вебера [@weber1924] и Толкотта Парсонса [@parsons2015], и продолжает развиваться сегодня. *Равновесный подход* рассматривает институты как поведенческие регулярности и, что наиболее важно, как решения проблем координации (традиция Льюиса) и кооперации (традиция институциональной экономики). *Подход конститутивных правил* видит институты как системы правил, присваивающие статусы и функции физическим объектам и наделяющие их деонтическими силами (традиция Сёрла).

Авторы утверждают, что концепции конститутивных правил и равновесных объяснений, распространённые в экономике, могут быть интегрированы с помощью понятия КР. Их ключевая идея состоит в том, что *конститутивные правила не являются онтологически фундаментальными*, а могут быть реконструированы из систем регулятивных правил, действующих в условиях координационных равновесий в повторяющихся играх [@guala2015].
 
В КР каждый агент следует *условной стратегии* вида «если $X$, делай $Y$». Гуала и Хиндрикс отмечают, что это и есть регулятивное правило, как оно встречается у Сёрла [@guala2015]. Например, два пастуха могут принять стратегии «пасти скот, если находишься к северу от реки» и «пасти скот, если к югу», тем самым решая проблему координации. Стратегия каждого агента эквивалентна регулятивному правилу, предписывающему, что делать при данных обстоятельствах. Следовательно, согласно Гуале и Хиндриксу, институты есть *совокупности регулятивных правил*, образующих устойчивое КР.

Более того, привычная конститутивная формулировка «X считается Y в контексте C» может быть выведена из регулятивного правила как сокращённая запись. Гуала и Хиндрикс показывают, что, вводя новые институциональные термины, можно преобразовать регулятивные условные конструкции в конститутивную форму:

$$
\text{Участок земли к северу от реки (X) считается *собственностью* племени Нуэр (Y) в контексте локализации соседства племён Нуэр и Динка(C)}
$$

По мнению авторов, подход, основанный на правилах, недостаточен, поскольку не может объяснить, почему одни правила соблюдаются, а другие — нет. Чтобы решить эту проблему, необходим равновесный подход, демонстрирующий стратегический характер следования правилам.

Гуала и Хиндрикс иллюстрируют это, сравнивая две парадигмальные игры из теории игр: «дилемму заключённого» и «охоту на оленя».

 <div class="caption">Диллема заключенного (слева) и Охота на оленя (справа)</div> 
 </div> 


Хотя взаимное предательство в дилемме заключённого — равновесие Нэша, это не социальный институт, поскольку оно не является самоподдерживающимся из‑за независимости стратегий игроков. Напротив, обоюдное решение охотиться на оленя, а не на зайца (оба варианта также являются равновесиями Нэша) — это уже институт, поскольку для достижения большего совместного выигрыша требуется, как пишут Гуала и Хиндрикс, корреляция стратегий игроков. Последнее означает, что стратегия является «очевидной» и выгодной для игроков, что и объясняет, почему одни правила соблюдаются, а другие — нет.

Однако, как отмечают авторы, понятие коррелированных стратегий игроков как объяснительный принцип устойчивости институтов также недостаточно, поскольку слишком широко. Авторы приводят пример решения проблем координации животными с помощью коррелирующих устройств при отсутствии институтов. Например, самцы бабуинов, львов, ласточек, бабочек и других видов демонстрируют поведенческую модель, которую можно описать в терминах КР: самцы патрулируют территорию для спаривания с самками и вступают в *ритуальные* бои с нарушителями при встрече. Эта пара стратегий минимизирует возможный ущерб для обеих сторон и позволяет доминирующему самцу занимать территорию и спариваться [@smith1982].

Согласно авторам, различие между «животными конвенциями» и человеческими социальными институтами заключается в спектре сигналов, на которые можно реагировать. Набор сигналов, на которые могут реагировать животные, значительно уже, чем у людей, из‑за тесной связи стимула и реакции, необходимой для достижения координации. Однако, как отмечают Гуала и Хиндрикс с опорой на идеи Кима Стерельны [@sterelny2003], люди способны разъединять стимул и поведение с помощью репрезентации окружающей среды, обусловливающей поведение. Иначе говоря, люди, по мнению авторов, способны изобретать и следовать различным правилам при наличии одного и того же коррелирующего устройства. 

Правила — это репрезентации стратегий в заданной игре. Эти репрезентации не только служат символическими маркерами свойств равновесий, но и значительно экономят когнитивные усилия. Подводя итог учёту *правил‑в‑равновесии*, как отмечает экономист Масахико Аоки, на идеи которого опираются Гуала и Хиндрикс:

> «Институт — это самоподдерживающийся, салиентный паттерн социального взаимодействия, репрезентированный значимыми правилами, которые знает каждый агент и которые инкорпорированы как разделяемые агентами убеждения о способах разыгрывания игры» [@aoki2007, 6].

Тот же Аоки очерчивает институт как двухуровневую систему, где стратегический выбор агентов создаёт объективное состояние игры, это состояние выражается публичной репрезентацией, эта репрезентация способствует формированию ожиданий и верований, которые служат источником стратегического выбора агентов [@aoki2011]. Гуала и Хиндрикс согласны с такой механикой функционирования института:

```
--------------------                  --------------
стратегический выбор    создаёт →     состояние игры
--------------------                  --------------

```

В ответ на теорию правил-в-равновесии Cёрл утверждает, что для конститутивных правил необходима нормативность, и конститутивные правила принципиально несводимы к регулятивным. поскольку между ними есть онтологическая разница [@searle2015]. Гуала и Хиндрикс же защищают позицию, что конститутивные правила фактически выводимы из регулятивных и, следовательно, редуцируемы к последним [@hindriks2015].

<!--Также можно преобразовать любое конститутивное правило обратно в регулятивную форму. Предполагаемая новизна конститутивных правил оказывается вторичной: они маркируют то, что уже установлено коррелированными стратегиями агентов. Институты, согласно теории правил-в-равновесии, «состоят из регулятивных правил», и конститутивные формулировки могут быть опущены без потери содержания.-->

Важно, что *Гуала переосмысляет проект Серла в теоретико-игровых терминах, не отказываясь от его интуиций*. Он признаёт, что институциональные статусы влияют на то, как мы классифицируем мир и действуем в нём, но настаивает, что эти статусы всегда согласованы с поведенческими регулярностями, выраженными как КР. Тем самым акцент Серла на конструкции “counts-as” можно восстановить как эпифеномен координации — кажущуюся творческую *силу языка*[^power-of-language], которая в действительности является не более чем эффектом коррелированных стратегических профилей. Как формулируют Гуала и Хиндрикс:

> "язык — лишь одно из множества координационных устройств и не обладает большей творческой силой, чем подбрасывание монеты или любое другое событие, которое игроки могут использовать для координации своих решений" [@guala2015].

[^power-of-language]: Серл делает деонтические силы институциональных фактов зависимыми от языка. В то же время данные когнитивной археологии, что ранние гоминины могли решать проблемы координации без языка. Философ биологии Ким Стерельны утверждает, что социальные институты (или человеческий социальный контракт), понимаемые как разделяемые и поддающиеся принуждению нормы, регулирующие кооперацию и взаимность, возникли *до появления сложного языка* [@sterelny2021]. Археологические данные показывают, что ранние гоминины участвовали в кооперативном добывании пищи и согласованном использовании орудий. Это указывает на взаимовыгодное сотрудничество и неявное принуждение к нормам в малых мобильных группах уже около 1,8 млн лет назад [@sterelny2021; @sterelny2016]. Сравнительные исследования приматов также подтверждают правдоподобие *доязыковой кооперации и элементарного нормативного контроля*, демонстрируя формы взаимности и социальной регуляции у человекообразных обезьян, которые, вероятно, служили основой раннего человеческого сотрудничества [@birch2022]. Вместе эти данные поддерживают модель Стерельного, согласно которой прото-социальные контракты, укоренённые в нормах, репутации и координации, существовали в доязыковых обществах, а язык позднее позволил формировать более абстрактные, масштабируемые и формализованные нормы по мере расширения человеческих групп. Хотя Серл не рассматривал институты как решения координационных проблем, это важно с точки зрения натуралистической социальной онтологии.

Гуала и Хиндрикс утверждают, что нормативные аспекты можно моделировать как модификации выигрышей базовой игры, аналогичные $\delta$-параметрам у Остром [@crawford1995]. Нормативное правило добавляет стимулы или санкции, делающие определённые действия — например, кооперацию — более привлекательными. На практике это означает, что если агенты получают «право» или несут «обязанность», мы представляем это, вставляя издержки или выгоды в матрицу выигрышей. Это преобразует игру с ненулевой суммой в координационную игру, где эффективное равновесие становится более заметным.

Гуала показывает, что добавление таких нормативных издержек может создавать новые равновесия, ранее отсутствовавшие, или делать социально оптимальный исход устойчивым. Важно, что эти модификации не требуют введения отдельной онтологической категории помимо стандартных инструментов теории игр. Нормативные силы просто становятся частью равновесной структуры: они обеспечивают координацию, изменяя стимулы. Гуала и Хиндрикс демонстрируют, что любое статусное правило — например, право пользоваться, передавать или исключать — может быть переформулировано как регулятивное правило после включения нормативных полномочий.

По сути, Гуала и Хиндрикс поддерживают трансформационный взгляд: любой институт, описываемый конститутивным правилом, может быть равным образом описан как набор регулятивных норм, включающих необходимые разрешения и запреты. Само существование статуса $Y$ просто обозначает определённые равновесные отношения между агентами, стоящие «за ним». Переводя статусные функции Серла в терминологию равновесий, унифицированная онтология связывает институциональные «долженствования» со стратегической координацией.

### 1.3.2 Критика теории правил-в-равновесии
Несмотря на свою инновационность, теория Гуалы и Хиндрикса не лишена критики, поскольку сведение конститутивных правил к равновесиям, по мнению оппонентов, упускает важные аспекты социальной реальности.

#### Пренебрежение материальными и историческими аспектами 
Рабинович хвалит Гуалу за широкий синтез, но высказывает опасения по поводу сосредоточенности на понятии равновесия. Он указывает, что трактовка институтов как «правил‑в‑равновесии» может искажать их онтологию, игнорируя материальные субстраты и историю [@rabinowicz2018].

Многие институты, такие как университеты, денежные системы, рынки и традиции, включают *конкретных людей, практики и блага*, а не только абстрактные стратегии. Материальная основа разыгрываемых игр — например, студенты и аудитории в университете, — по утверждению Рабиновича, является неотъемлемой частью институтов, и её нельзя абстрагировать, не проигнорав «базовую онтологию» моделируемых явлений. 

Эта критика представляется нам неубедительной, поскольку понятие «базовой онтологии» вводит в заблуждение, подразумевая некую «народную онтологию» и приверженность концептуальному анализу, который рассматривает интуицию о социальном мире как валидную отправную точку для онтологического исследования. Модели абстрагируют несущественные части рассматриваемых систем. 

Хотя мы согласны, что всегда есть конкретные люди и практики со своей материальной основой, включение «базовой (или народной) онтологии» несущественно для объяснения структуры социальной онтологии, возникновения и устойчивости её ключевых элементов. Также можно сказать, что теория Гуалы уже учитывает подобные «народные» онтологии в виду Y-понятий (деньги, брак и т.д.).

Другой аргумент Рабиновича — что множество возможных КР шире множества РН. Это усложняет, а не упрощает проблему выбора равновесия, поскольку существует бесконечное количество возможных вероятностных распределений, способных порождать множество КР‑конфигураций. 

#### Нередуцируемость нормативности

Сёрл критикует ПвР, говоря что равновесия не объясняют деонтическую силу и что невозможно редуцировать конститутивные правила к регулятивным. Он начинает с того, что институциональные факты — это статусные функции, присваивающие материальным объектам новый статус, а институты — это системы, делающие возможных создание и поддержание статусных функций. Он делает сильное утверждение, что любая теория институтов — это теория статусных функций [@searle2015, 506]. 

Согласно Сёрлу, равновесный подход не способен объяснить деонтологию: права и обязанности, служащие определяющей чертой институциональных фактов. При этом он разводит нормативность и деонтическую силу: любое правило нормативно, но не любое создаёт, например, обязательства. Для Сёрла «способность создавать обязательства и права» — определяющее свойство институтов, которое равновесный подход, по его мнению, не схватывает. 

Помимо этого Сёрл имплицитно относится к равновесию как чему-то оптимальному и приводит пример федерального закона США 1862 года о частной собственности: что несмотря на закон, люди все равно находили способы его обойти, и это, по мнению Сёрла, не может быть «равновесием Нэша».

Сёрл считает, что чтобы редуцировать конститутивные правила к регулятивным, нужно показать, как регулятивные правила на одном «уровне» генерируют деонтоические силы «на уровень выше». Сёрл считает, что это невозможно.  

Роверси менее радикально отстаивает важность конститутивных правил и тоже критикует редукционизм теории [@roversi2021]. Трактовка конститутивных правил как «сжатых» регулятивных лишает их нормативной сущности. С его точки зрения, этот взгляд не объясняет, почему индивиды чувствуют себя связанными институциональными нормами. Роверси настаивает, что нельзя уловить смысл статуса (например, профессора) одними лишь условными правилами, поскольку они подразумевают более сложное понятие нормативности. 

В недавних работах Хиндрикс развивает собственную ветку теории ПвР и критикует Гуалу по тем же основаниям, что Сёрл и Роверси — что инструментальная рациональность равновесий не схватывает нормативности и деонтических оснований следования правилам [@hindriks2019]. В концепции Хиндрикса, которую он называет «правила-и-равновесия», социальные институты — это *управляемые нормами социальные практики*. Он утверждает, что моделирование социальных норм как санкций, налагающих издержки за их нарушение, недостаточно для восприятия норм агентами как *легитимных*. В его концепции есть два вида правил: одни создают пространство для игры, вторые его регулируют.

Согласно Хиндриксу, инструментальный подход не схватывает мотивацию *самими нормами*, а не издержками её нарушения. Это проблема восприятия агентами стратегических ограничений равновесий как *легитимных*. Именно *нормативные ожидания*, по мысли Хиндрикса, и особенно *нормативные убеждения*, дополняют санкции в качестве источника нормы и её восприятия как легитимной. *Социальная норма управляет практикой*, если её участники в значительной степени *мотивированы* следовать её правилу. В этом смысле Хиндрикс разводит нормативность и равновесия.

#### Переоценка роли координации

Ванершрааф критикует ПвР за слишком широкую трактовку институтов и отсутствие механизмов коррекции неравновесных состояний [@Vanderschraaf_2017]. С его точки зрения, координационные равновесия не вполне отражают суть институтов: *не все конвенции — социальные институты*, поскольку последние предполагают права, обязанности и *несимметричные роли*.

Чтобы показать, что не все конвенции — институты, Вандершрааф использует игру на доверие. В ней Клиент либо доверяет Инвестору свои деньги в размере 1 единицы ($T$), либо нет ($M$). Если Клиент доверяет, Инвестор использует эти деньги, чтобы создать $2\aplha \geq 2$ и после этого либо сотрудничает ($C$, cooperate) c Клиентом, деля с ним выручку поровну, либо нет ($D$, defect), забирая всё себе. 

картинка

Ожидаемо, что в такой конфигурации игроки будут следовать неэффективному равновесию ($M$, $D-if-T$), поскольку $D$ — строго доминирующая стратегия Инвестора, если клиент выбирает доверять ($T$), поскольку это классическая «Дилемма заключенного». 

Чтобы равновесие стало эффективным, считает Вандершрааф, нужен институт. Для этого он расширяет игру на доверие, следуя идее Роберта Таделиса [@tadelis2013, 205-7]. В ней Инвестор может либо зарегистрироваться ($R$) у Гаранта за стоимость $\epslion \in (0,1)$, либо нет ($N$). Если Инвестор регистрируется, то он платит защитный депозит $d \geq 2\alpha$ Гаранту, который затем следит за сделкой между Клиентом и Инвестором. Если Клиент доверяет, а Инвестор обманывает, то Гарант забирает депозит Инвестора себе. А если Инвестор не обманывает, то Гарант возвращает ему  депозит.

В такой конфигурации обманывать Клиента Инвестору становится невыгодно, поскольку защитный депозит превышает возможный выигрыш от обмана. А регулятивные правила Клиента ($R_C$) и Инвестора ($R_I$) выглядят так:
$$
\begin{gathered}
R_I: \text{R then C if T}
R_C: \text{T if R, M if N}
\end{gathered}
$$
Вандершрааф называет подобную конфигурацию «открытым институтом», поскольку роли Клиента и Гаранта не связаны между собой и следуют своим стратегиями автоматически. Для «закрытого института» нужны дополнительные механизмы, регулирующие случаи, когда Клиент не доверяет Инвестору, даже если у того есть регистрация с Гарантом, или если Гарант забирает себе депозит даже у честного инвестора.

Помимо этого новшество Вандершраафа, которого нет у Гуалы — говорить о регулятивных правилах и КР в контексте семантики возможных миров. Например, в игре «Ястреб-Голубь» Вандершрааф трактует регулятивное правило «моя территория, если я пришёл первым» как межмировое обобщение возможных стратегий. Это  

что это дает?



Наша позиция близка к предложению Вандершраафа и критикует ПвР на подобных основаниях, однако у него не вполне ясна роль конститутивных правил в контексте унифицированной социальной онтологии. Если Гарант и есть институт, то как это укладывается в формулу «X  считается Y в контексте C»?





Эдуин критикует ПвР за переоценку координации как основы института [@hedoin2016; @hedoin2021]. Хотя теоретико‑игровой подход Гуалы предлагает элегантную и экономную модель институтов как координационных равновесий, в конечном счёте она слишком «тонка», чтобы охватить полную социальную онтологию институтов. Конструктивный тезис Эдуина призывает к более широкой, нормативно насыщенной и исторически укоренённой рамке, которая признаёт институты как конституирующие предпочтения и идентичности агентов, встроенные в социальные и культурные контексты и наделённые нормативными силами, порождающими подлинные обязательства. 

Подобный более богатый подход призван объяснить не только то, как институты решают проблемы координации, но и то, как они формируют социальную жизнь на фундаментальном уровне. Основная новая идея состоит в том, чтобы *сделать экзогенные предпочтения эндогенными*, где равновесия не отражают предпочтения агентов, а *формируют* их. Например, институт брака меняет то, как индивиды ценят отношения, а не только то, как они координируют поведение. Это измерение отсутствует в подходе Гуалы, основанном на матрице выигрышей.

Хотя указанная критика высвечивает важные недостатки теории правил‑в‑равновесии, большинство её авторов не углубляются достаточно, чтобы увидеть проблему в самой структуре этой теории, которая влияет на её объяснительную силу. 

<!--Как я буду доказывать в следующем разделе, существуют внутренние проблемы с ключевыми понятиями «корреляция» и «репрезентация» в рамках теории правил‑в‑равновесии, которые делают проблематичным введение правил и всё объяснение, основанное на сравнении теоретико‑игровых моделей в человеческих и животных случаях.-->


### 1.3.3 Глубокая проблема: соотношение правил и равновесий
Корень проблемы, по моему мнению, глубже — в отношении между правилами и равновесиями в теории Гуалы. Аргументируя унификацию институтов как правил и равнвовесий, Гуала исходит из недостаточности каждого элемента по отдельности: правила могут не иметь принудительной силы и не соблюдаться, а равновесия описывают слишком большой класс феноменов — например, решение территориальных споров у животных [@hindriks2015a]. 

Решение Гуалы — приравнять регулятивные правила вроде «стой на красный, иди на зеленый» к условным стратегиям агентов в играх. Точнее, он говорит, что это два взгляда на одну и ту же сущность: с точки зрения действующего агента это правила, а с точки зрения наблюдателя — условные стратегии, ведущие к коррелированному равновесию [@guala2015]. Правила, по утверждению Гуалы, «неотъемлемы для *достижения* равновесий, формирующих институты» [@hindriks2015a, 463, курсив мой], то есть логически им предшествуют. Однако в другом месте Гуала говорит, что правила — это «репрезентации стратегий <…>, которым *должно* (ought) следовать в игре» [@hindriks2015a, 467, курсив мой]. При этом долженствование (принудительный характер институтов) следует из инструментальной рациональности КР — игрокам не выгодно отклоняться от стратегии, предложенной устройством корреляции. Сам Гуала признаёт, что это «слабая нормативность» инструментальной рациональности, а не деонтические силы в полной мере, как это есть у Сёрла [@guala2015].

Теория Гуалы создаёт круг в определении: правила помогают агентам достичь равновесий и одновременно репрезентируют уже существующие стратегии, которым необходимо следовать в игре, а нормативность возникает из равновесия. Неясно, что онтологически первично — правила или равновесия, и откуда и почему возникает нормативность. Всё это затрудняет определение онтологии социального института.

Во второй главе я подробно рассматриваю отношение между правилом и равновесием в теории Гуалы.

<!--### Санкционная связность, материальность и нормативность институтов-->
<!---->
<!--Один из центральных споров в теории социальных институтов касается относительной роли нормативных ожиданий и материальных или технических структур в обеспечении устойчивости социального порядка. Нормативные подходы трактуют институты как системы правил, поддерживаемых убеждениями, ожиданиями и санкциями, тогда как социоматериальные и акторно-сетевые теории подчёркивают роль объектов, инфраструктур и технических артефактов в стабилизации социальных практик. Часто предполагается, что эти объяснения конкурируют между собой. Однако такое противопоставление является методологически вводящим в заблуждение.-->
<!---->
<!--В настоящей работе предлагается альтернативная перспектива, согласно которой нормы и материальные структуры не являются онтологически различными основаниями институциональной устойчивости, а выступают *взаимозаменяемыми носителями санкционной связности*. Под санкционной связностью понимается степень, в которой применение санкций за отклонение от равновесного поведения является регулярным, ожидаемым и связным между различными игровыми ситуациями. Институты различаются не по своей «нормативности» или «материальности» как таковой, а по тому, каким образом достигается и поддерживается необходимый уровень санкционной связности.-->
<!---->
<!--Это позволяет переосмыслить классическую проблему, сформулированную в социоматериальных теориях, в частности в вопросе Латура о «недостающей массе» социального, где технические объекты интерпретируются как воплощённые моральные нормы. В предлагаемой рамке такие объекты не столько материализуют нормы, сколько выполняют функциональную роль стабилизации поведения за счёт повышения плотности санкций. Ремень безопасности, бюрократическая процедура или алгоритмический фильтр различаются по форме, но эквивалентны в той мере, в какой они обеспечивают предсказуемость и неизбежность последствий отклонения.-->
<!---->
<!--Эта идея может быть обобщена в следующем структурном принципе институциональной устойчивости:-->
<!---->
<!--> **Устойчивые институты требуют структур обеспечения санкций, плотность которых пропорциональна информационной хрупкости поддерживаемого равновесия.**-->
<!---->
<!--Под *информационной хрупкостью* понимается степень чувствительности равновесия к неполной информации, асимметрии ожиданий, блефу и стратегической неопределённости. В условиях низкой хрупкости — например, в малых группах с высокой повторяемостью взаимодействий — институциональная стабильность может поддерживаться преимущественно за счёт нормативных ожиданий и неформальных санкций. По мере роста хрупкости равновесия возрастает необходимость в более плотных и автоматизированных механизмах санкционирования, включая формальные организации, материальную инфраструктуру и, в современных условиях, алгоритмические системы исполнения правил.-->
<!---->
<!--Таким образом, спор между нормативными и социоматериальными теориями институтов может быть разрешён не путём выбора одной из сторон, а через функциональное различение уровней и механизмов стабилизации. Нормы, бюрократия и технические системы представляют собой различные решения одной и той же задачи — поддержания устойчивого равновесия при заданном уровне информационной неопределённости. Это смещает акцент институциональной теории с онтологического вопроса о природе социального к анализу условий, при которых те или иные механизмы стабилизации становятся необходимыми или избыточными.-->
