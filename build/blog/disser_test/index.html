non-contradictory theoretical core in sociology is the &lt;em&gt;lack of
ontological constraints on concepts&lt;/em&gt;. It implies insufficient
empirical data substantiation, as well as a lack of commitment criteria

      <p>Ontology studies “what there is” in the world: what exists
      genuinely and nonredundantly <span class="citation" data-cites="baker2019">(Baker, 2019)</span>. Any science strives
      to answer this question. Ontological commitments shape scientific
      explanations, implicitly or explicitly, and explanatory power of
      theories reflects its ontological assumptions. The choice of study
      methods, in its turn, reflects an intended way of explanation and
      demonstrates a commitment to a particular “version of the world”
      <span class="citation" data-cites="moon2014">(Moon &amp; Blackman,
      2014)</span><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
      <!--[^explanation]: @bunge1997 rejects the distinction of explanation and understanding, arguing that the former depends on the latter: *"I understand a fact F if and only if I know a satisfactory explanation of F. … E is a satisfactory explanation of F if and only if E involves a well-confirmed or at least plausible mechanism compatible with the known laws (or norms). … Therefore I understand fact F if and only if I know a verified or at least plausible mechanism for F"* [-bunge1997, 456].-->
      <p>In any science, the relative coherence of its ontological
      picture paired with its explanatory power is connected to its
      “maturity”. There are predictively and explanatory powerful
      theories of quantum gravity, autocatalytic cycles and social
      network dynamics as soon as there are empirically adequate
      descriptions of entities invoked in these theories<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p>
      <p>A viable ontology is both a product and a project of any
      science. It is a foil for future research and an ultimate goal of
      knowing “what there is”. Conjectures about the nature of objects
      of study influence the ways of approaching them: if the social
      world, for example, is comprised of individuals, you will probably
      study individuals, their properties and relationships between
      them. Philosophy and history of science have seen cases when
      mistaken ontology led to scientific mistakes<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>. In social science, the issue
      of ontology is even more complicated due to its multi-paradigm
      nature and lack of shared foundations: diverse objects of study,
      methods used for studying them and explanatory strategies<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>.</p>
      <p>The relevance of studying ontology in social science stems from
      two things:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>its connection with cumulative growth of knowledge <span class="citation" data-cites="lauer2019">(Lauer, 2019)</span> which
      is the main aim of science <span class="citation" data-cites="bird2022">(<strong>bird2022?</strong>)</span></li>
      <li>its connection to policy-making and potential usage in social
      design <span class="citation" data-cites="tromp2023 vink20232">(Tromp &amp; Vial, 2023; Vink
      &amp; Koskela-Huotari, 2023)</span>, which is said to be detached
      from social science <span class="citation" data-cites="eriksson2010">(Eriksson, 2010)</span>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Having a set of core concepts and a unifying principle like
      mechanics in physics and evolution by natural selection in biology
      would propel social science to higher explanatory and predictive
      power. Although some scholars argue that multi-paradigm nature of
      social science is a “feature” and not a “bug” as social reality is
      intrinsically complex and highly contextual <span class="citation" data-cites="little2016">(Little, 2016)</span>, it still impedes
      cumulative growth of knowledge <span class="citation" data-cites="genov2019">(Genov, 2019)</span>. As Porpora notes, in
      terms of Kuhn <span class="citation" data-cites="kuhn2009">(2009)</span>, sociology is not a mature
      science, but a pre-science <span class="citation" data-cites="porpora2015">(<strong>porpora2015?</strong>)</span>.
      And, as Kuhn suggested, an appropriate activity in such a state is
      continuing the search for a discipline-wide consensus.</p>
      <p><span class="citation" data-cites="turner2001">Turner
      (2001)</span> suggested that social science is still at a stage
      similar to biology before Darwin’s theory of evolution. In
      biology, scientists have studied flora and fauna extensively,
      understanding their local habitats, predicting natural phenomena
      like frost damage to buds and soil improvement leading to better
      growth. This study resulted in the creation of “field guides”
      documenting this detailed knowledge. While these studies provided
      rich insights into individual species and their environments (like
      niche analysis), they did not explain how species originate and
      change over time. The unifying principle consolidated ontological
      pictures by explaining the mechanisms of emergence of entities
      like species. Further research and subsequent evolutionary
      synthesis enriched ontological picture of biology.</p>
      <p>Just as biology relied on evolutionary theory to understand
      biological processes more broadly and universally, social science
      is currently using various methodologies to study specific
      societies, cultures, or other phenomena, but needs a comprehensive
      explanatory framework to address foundational questions about how
      these systems emerge and change and what does exist in the social
      realm. There have been candidates for such a framework, from older
      ones like structural functionalism <span class="citation" data-cites="parsons1937">(Parsons, 1937)</span> and
      self-referential system theory <span class="citation" data-cites="luhmann1995">(Luhmann, 1995)</span> to newer ones like
      rational choice theory <span class="citation" data-cites="coleman1990 fararo1989">(Fararo, 1989;
      <strong>coleman1990?</strong>)</span>, critical realism <span class="citation" data-cites="archer1995 elder-vass2010">(Elder-Vass, 2010;
      <strong>archer1995?</strong>)</span>, assemblage theory <span class="citation" data-cites="delanda2019">(DeLanda, 2019)</span>
      and ‘analytical’ sociology based around the notion of social
      mechanisms <span class="citation" data-cites="hedstrom2005 demeulenaere2010 hedstrom2009">(Demeulenaere,
      2010; Hedstrom, 2005; Hedström &amp; Bearman, 2009)</span>. All of
      them made valuable contributions, but none have become mainstream
      discipline-wide and, more importantly, outside of sociology.</p>
      <p>Along with sociologists, philosophers of social science have
      been offering definitions of the scope and objects of sociology
      and broader social science, devising analytical truths about the
      social domain. Some of them claim that <em>analytic</em> social
      ontology based on conceptual analysis is prior to social
      scientific methodology <span class="citation" data-cites="searle1995 epstein2016 lauer2019">(Epstein, 2016;
      Lauer, 2019; J. Searle, 1995)</span>. Others criticize this
      approach as detached from actual science and not “naturalistic”

      <p>An important yet subtle distinction must be made before
      proceeding: that of “sociological ontology” and social ontology.
      The former is the inward-oriented study of the foundations of
      sociology and is closely connected with empirical and theoretical
      research within sociology. The works of critical realists <span class="citation" data-cites="archer1995 elder-vass2010 lawson2019">(Elder-Vass,

      social ontology is a science-independent philosophical study of
      the social entities started in analytic philosophy. It uses the
      conceptual analysis and tools like set theory, possible worlds
      semantics, ontological dependence and the like for which sometimes
      get criticized as detached from science. Although there is no such
      distinction in the literature, adopting one can clarify the
      contribution of the current work, which is to sociological
      ontology.</p>
      <p>The remainder of this chapter is structured as follows. In the
      second section I argue that sociological ontology is the most
      reliable way of doing social ontology. I do that by defending
      inference to the best explanation (IBE) as a methodology for doing
      social ontology.In the third section, I argue that multi-paradigm
      character of sociology and the alleged lack of widely-accepted
      foundations is due to the lack of ontological constraints on
      concepts. There, I review major attempts at unification of
      sociology and identify key useful notions and a “checklist” for
      building social ontology.</p>

      <h2 id="what-it-means-to-talk-about-social-ontology">What it means
      to talk about ‘social ontology’</h2>
      <p>A good deal of current social ontology is detached from actual
      social science <span class="citation" data-cites="sarkia2023">(Sarkia &amp; Kaidesoja, 2023)</span>. It
      is mostly developed in analytic philosophy <span class="citation" data-cites="baker2019 searle1995 epstein2015 gilbert1992">(Baker,
      2019; Epstein, 2015; Gilbert, 1992; J. Searle, 1995)</span> and
      social scientific strand tradition of critical realism <span class="citation" data-cites="archer1995 elder-vass2010">(Elder-Vass, 2010;
      <strong>archer1995?</strong>)</span>. There are views that social
      ontology is intrinsically more complex than any “natural” ontology
      for being “interactive”, or dependent on beliefs of individuals
      and hence changeable <span class="citation" data-cites="hacking1999 epstein2015">(Epstein, 2015; Hacking,
      1999)</span> and that social reality is inherently normative which
      means it cannot be descriptive and hence cannot import
      methodologies from “natural” ontologies <span class="citation" data-cites="asta2024 haslanger2012">(Ásta, 2024; Haslanger,
      2012)</span> which render and justify the importance of an
      “extra-scientific” study of the social world. To me, these are two
      distinct projects: a set of <em>mutually coherent and explanatory
      powerful descriptions</em> of social phenomena and a normative
      theory of thereof.</p>
      <p>According to <span class="citation" data-cites="epstein2018">Epstein (2018)</span>, the field of
      social ontology divides into two distinct inquiries. The first one
      deals with the constituents of social entities and addresses the
      question “what is the social world composed of?”. The second
      strand of research is concerned with the construction of social
      categories, or kinds, and with the question “how do social kinds
      like money, borders, marriage and others get established?”.
      Individual people constituting a social group exemplify the former
      inquiry and children playing a game where stuffed animals have a
      tea party exemplify the latter (as they have “set up” the
      conditions for something to be a tea party) <span class="citation" data-cites="epstein2015">(Epstein, 2015, p. 57)</span>.</p>
      <p>The difference between strands is in metaphysical relation of
      individuals to social facts. In the case of individuals and
      groups, social facts supervene on the facts about individuals,
      meaning that social properties cannot change without changing the
      individual ones. In the case of a toy toy party, facts about
      individuals set up the conditions for something to count as a
      social fact <span class="citation" data-cites="epstein2015">(2015,
      p. 58)</span>. One of the most famous expressions of the latter is
      Searle’s <span class="citation" data-cites="searle1995">(1995)</span> formula “X counts as Y in
      context C”. For example, “bills issued by the Bureau of Engraving
      and Printing (X) count as dollars (Y) in the United States (C)“
      <span class="citation" data-cites="searle1995">(1995, p.
      28)</span>. Epstein calls the former relationship”grounding” and
      the latter “anchoring”, where grounding is responsible for
      instantiation conditions for a social fact or category like money,
      and anchoring is responsible for the mechanism of establishing
      these conditions. For example, in Searle’s case, collective
      acceptance of the fact X is such a mechanism<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a>.</p>
      <p>Such consideration exemplifies one of the two main views on the
      role of metaphysics<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> in scientific inquiry,
      specifically in the sociological one. The first, empiricist one,
      renders metaphysics irrelevant and redundant or, if taken
      seriously, expects its constraints on models to impede the
      knowledge growth. The other view presupposes special metaphysical
      concepts beyond the vocabulary of science itself. For example,
      they discern grades of possibility and necessity largely unknown
      to science and go beyond causal dependence widely used in science
      <span class="citation" data-cites="ross2023">(Ross,
      2023)</span>.</p>
      <p><span class="citation" data-cites="ross2023">Ross (2023)</span>
      suggests the distinction of <em>analytic</em> and
      <em>scientific</em> social ontology, where the former is derived
      from conceptual analyses and the latter is based on empirical
      investigations. For Ross, ‘naturalistic metaphysics’ as he calls
      it, does not apply transcendental concepts except those featured
      in theories, models or explanations of “first-order science”. Ross
      defends what he calls ‘radically naturalistic metaphysics’ which
      is aimed at promoting scientific progress and might involve
      unifying or synthesising scientific discoveries.</p>
      <p>Physics provides better contrast for comparing scientific and
      analytic metaphysics. Ontology of physics is formulated in
      mathematical terms requiring some technical proficiency.
      Formulating ontology of physics in an analytic way with “possible
      worlds” and “propositions” would be counterintuitive and
      unnecessarily difficult. It would require translation of already
      existing scientific concepts into the language of analytic
      metaphysics.</p>
      <p>Social science does not enjoy straightforfardness of
      methematical formulations of its concepts<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a>. Instead, it invites “folk”
      concepts like “beliefs”, “groups” and “social facts” in its
      ontologies. Further divide comes from the attitude towards this
      ambiguity. Some scholars argue that such “folk” ontologies are
      sufficient <span class="citation" data-cites="ruben1989">(<strong>thomassen2003?</strong>)</span>
      and others put an interplay of “folk” and social scientific
      ontologies to the fore by bridging what <span class="citation" data-cites="sellars1962">(<strong>sellars1962?</strong>)</span>
      called “manifest” and “scientific” images<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> of phenomena within their
      social ontological theorizing <span class="citation" data-cites="asta2012 guala2016 haslanger2018">(Guala, 2016;
      <strong>asta2012?</strong>;
      <strong>haslanger2018?</strong>)</span>. The ambiguity between
      “folk” and scientific social ontology might indeed depend on
      mathematical apparatus and its underdeveloped character in social
      science. <span class="citation" data-cites="ross2023">Ross
      (2023)</span> also notes that ontology construction most probably
      will require its formulation with mathematical frameworks
      sensitive to structural modeling (like hierarchical Bayesian
      inference<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a>) and not set theory and
      similar tools from analytic metaphysics.</p>
      <p>With the distinction of analytic and scientific social
      metaphysics at hand, let us look at possible way of arriving at
      social ontology in detail. <span class="citation" data-cites="hawley2018">Hawley (2018)</span> assesses three
      possibilities: conceptual analysis, ameliorative (normative)
      approach and IBE. In terms of Ross, the first two fall into
      analytic approach and the last one falls into scientific approach
      to social metaphysics. From Hawley’s point of view, only the first
      two are potent. From my point of view, only the last one. Let us
      unpack and assess the possibilities.</p>
      <p><br></p>
      <h3 id="conceptual-analysis-and-the-standard-model-of-social-ontology">Conceptual
      analysis and the “Standard model of social ontology”</h3>
      <p>The method of conceptual analysis involves using logic and
      intuition to dissect concepts to arrive at necessary truths about
      the world. Practitioners of this approach start with a priori
      theorizing, taking concepts they view as important and breaking
      them into parts. For example, a prominent exampe of this in social
      ontology is Searle <span class="citation" data-cites="searle1995">(1995)</span> who asks whether it is
      possible to be epistemologically objective about ontologically
      subjective issues. How can we know the truths about things whose
      existence depends on our representations or feelings, for example,
      about money, property and marriage? By analysing these
      distinctions of ontology/epistemology and
      objectivity/subjectivity, Searle arrives at an idea of a missing
      ingredient that allows for an picture of ontologically subjective
      entities, which is constitutive rules of the form “X counts as Y
      in C” as in “bills issued by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing
      (X) count as dollars (Y) in the United States (C)” <span class="citation" data-cites="searle1995">(1995, p. 28)</span>.</p>
      <p><span class="citation" data-cites="guala2007">Guala
      (2007)</span> calls the approach to social ontology that uses
      conceptual analysis the “Standard model of social ontology”. This
      “model” describes the loosely constrained individualistic
      foundations of social phenomena and has three key elements:
      reflexivity, performativity and collective intentionality, as
      described by <span class="citation" data-cites="tuomela2002">Tuomela (2002)</span>. According to
      Guala, most philosophers endorsing the “Standard model“ subscribe
      under all three elements. Reflexivity is a property of social
      entities to be largely comprised of beliefs about beliefs. There
      are I-mode and we-mode formulations of reflexive beliefs. Some
      philosophers say that initial and most basic beliefs comprising
      “the fabric“ of the social are essentially in We-mode and are not
      reducible to I-mode <span class="citation" data-cites="tuomela2002 gilbert1992 schmid2023">(Gilbert, 1992;
      Schmid, 2023; Tuomela, 2002)</span>. However, there are also more
      individualistic accounts of reflexive beliefs based on game theory
      <span class="citation" data-cites="guala2016 bicchieri2005">(Bicchieri, 2005; Guala,
      2016)</span>. Performativity amounts to social entities needing to
      be continuously maintained, performed or recreated. Collective
      intentionality, in its turn, is joint directedness of multiple
      individuals towards a phenomenon that contributes to its
      constitution. Collective intentionality tends to be presented
      either as a derivative of common knowledge and I-beliefs of the
      form “everyone knows that everyone knows that P“, where P is some
      social fact like social norm <span class="citation" data-cites="bicchieri2005">(Bicchieri, 2005)</span>, or as a
      primitive notion which makes common knowledge redundant. Moreover,
      there are attempts to naturalize collective intentionality by
      showing its irreducibility to individual intentionality <span class="citation" data-cites="rakoczy2007 gallotti2012">(Gallotti,
      2012; Rakoczy &amp; Tomasello, 2007)</span>.</p>
      <p>Concepts can be arbitrary and not reflect the structure of the
      world. However, concepts like Gilbert’s “joint commitment” <span class="citation" data-cites="gilbert1992">(1992)</span> or
      Tuomela’s “we-intention” <span class="citation" data-cites="tuomela2002">(2002)</span> are not completely
      arbitrary, as Hawley notes, for they reflect <em>intuitive notions
      of the social world</em>. Having access to intuition makes
      conceptual analysis, according to Hawley, rather virtuous in the
      context of philosophy of social science than in philosophy of
      natural sciences, for mind-dependent social world is presumably
      more epistemically translucent to its inhabitants than
      mind-independent matter.</p>
      <p>To illustrate this point, Hawley uses Hacking’s distinction of
      interactive and indifferent kinds, where the former are involved
      in reflexive loops with beliefs and the latter are not <span class="citation" data-cites="hacking1999">(Hacking, 1999)</span>.
      Our classifications of the social world help establish and
      maintain it, whereas non-social objects are indifferent to our
      classifications of it. Nature’s objects do not change their
      behaviour given these classifications of them as opposed to social
      objects. This idea illustrates the notions of reflexivity and
      performativity characteristic for the “Standard model”. If social
      entities are comprised of beliefs about beliefs, their nature
      depends on these beliefs, and if beliefs change, social entities
      change accordingly. If social entities depend on beliefs about
      them, it is needed to constantly perform those to maintain them.
      To do this, it is needed that individuals have collective
      intentionality about these beliefs. For example, for money to be
      itself, it is needed for a relevant community to hold a collective
      intention to believe that certain physical entities can be used as
      a medium of exchange.</p>
      <p>The three interconnected notions—reflexivity, performativity
      and collective intentionality—together with a method for arriving
      at them—conceptual analysis—presuppose that one cannot be mistaken
      about the nature of social entities, for they are posited a priori
      and based on intuitive concepts. Hence, if epistemic access is
      limited and truths are infallible, conceptual analysis cannot lead
      to viable social ontology <em>only by itself</em>. As Hawley sums
      up, conceptual analysis is still a useful methodology when used
      with caution, but it cannot securely lead to genuinely
      naturalistic social ontology and must be suppemented with
      empirical investifations.</p>
      <p>I see the argument about relative translucency of the social
      world based on intuition unsatisfying and argue that social
      ontology cannot operate solely on the basis of conceptual
      analysis. I follow Kincaid <span class="citation" data-cites="kincaid2021 kincaid2024">(Kincaid, 2021, 2024)</span>,
      <span class="citation" data-cites="ross2023">Ross (2023)</span>
      and <span class="citation" data-cites="churchland2019">(<strong>churchland2019?</strong>)</span>
      in that ontological claims based on conceptual analysis mistake
      the properties of the world for properties of the
      <em>word</em>.</p>
      <p><span class="citation" data-cites="kincaid2021">Kincaid
      (2021)</span> argues that current social ontology often builds on
      unfruitful analytic metaphysics, which ignores major 20th century
      philosophical results like the idea that science-independent
      knowledge solely by conceptual a priori analysis is problematic
      <span class="citation" data-cites="quine1960">(<strong>quine1960?</strong>)</span>.
      Social ontology follows this trend, rarely using real social
      science research. Conceptual analysis, Kincaid maintains, can
      indeed clarify concepts, but cannot replace empirical knowledge of
      the social world. More broadly, he suggests that traditional
      projects of conceptual analysis testing necessary and sufficient
      conditions against intuitions will not tell us much about the
      sciences we want to understand as philosophy does not first decide
      what is ontologically real or essential before science begins
      because it is a scientific question itself <span class="citation" data-cites="kincaid2014">(Kincaid, 2014)</span>.</p>
      <p><span class="citation" data-cites="churchland2019">(<strong>churchland2019?</strong>)</span>
      goes even further and, drawing on <span class="citation" data-cites="quine1960">(<strong>quine1960?</strong>)</span>,
      indicates that conceptual analysis as a methodology for making
      ontological claims is insufficient, for a concept reflects current
      beliefs and fallaciously mistakes their features for the features
      of the world. Churchland argues that a <em>concept’s applicability
      to real-world phenomena depends on science and discovering
      facts</em>. What is even more disturbing, she adds that often
      conceptual analysis yields not a reflection of a concept’s meaning
      but a camouflaged theory with ontological claims about some
      phenomenon. For instance, a theory that beliefs are semantic and
      require language <span class="citation" data-cites="schooler2014">(<strong>schooler2014?</strong>)</span>
      which has emerged with help of conceptual analysis and no
      empirical evidence.</p>
      <p>Ultimately, conceptual analysis and foundational metaphysical
      projects that try to “ground” social science in analytical truths
      <span class="citation" data-cites="epstein2015 epstein2016">(Epstein, 2015, 2016)</span>
      might be useful to clarify concepts, but are non-starters for the
      task of identifying a theoretical core of sociology.</p>
      <p><br></p>
      <h3 id="ameliorative-approach">Ameliorative approach</h3>
      <p>The second methodological approach to social ontology which
      Hawley reviews is an ameliorative one by <span class="citation" data-cites="haslanger2012">Haslanger (2012)</span>. Haslanger
      distinguishes between conceptual, descriptive and ameliorative
      approach to analysis of social categories like “race”, “gender”
      and others that can be extended to institutional categories like
      “marriage”, “borders” and others, as well. She makes another
      distinction between manifest and operative concepts, where the
      former is a theory individuals use to make sense of the term and
      the latter is a practice associated with it, what do people
      actually mean when they invoke a concept in the “wild”.</p>
      <p>In Haslanger’s view, conceptual approach sheds light on “our”
      manifest concept of, say, “marriage” by inquiring into what do
      “we” take it to be. It might show how different understandings of
      the term “marriage” changed over time and across social structure.
      Descriptive approach circumscribes the operative concept of
      “marriage” by explicating, where possible, natural (chemical,
      biological, neurological) constraints on paradigm cases of the
      term studied. Lastly, ameliorative approach defines “our” purposes
      regarding the term and elucidates what concept would fulfill this
      purpose. An important addition is that in the last case “normative
      input” is required. The implication of this approach to social
      concepts is that if one has a descriptively accurate theory but
      does not like its normative outcomes, she is entitled to
      discourage it.</p>
      <p>As Guala notes, Haslanger wants to put forward the idea that
      morally unacceptable institutions can and should be reformed <span class="citation" data-cites="guala2016b">(<strong>guala2016b?</strong>)</span>.
      However, as he notes, this position is in tension with realism,
      for the latter presupposes that reference of a category is
      determined by the world and not by “us”, which falls under
      Churchland’s criticism of a concept reflecting current belief and
      not a feature of the world. Ameliorative approach might be said to
      be a flavour of the “Standard model” as it shares the idea of
      reflexivity, or dependence of social ontology on beliefs of
      individuals. A shortcoming of this approach is reducing ontology
      to politics, which means that one should discuss and converge on
      “our” legitimate purposes regarding a studied term, which might
      not be self-evident thing to do.</p>
      <p>Ameliorative approach does not allow fallibilism which means
      you cannot mistake about the structure of the social world, for
      communal consensus is the criterion for a concept’s applicability
      and ontological verification. However, if one can be mistaken
      about operative and manifest concepts of a social category, she
      cannot be mistaken about its normative input as she defines it.
      And since normativity is explanatory essential to ameliorative
      approach, it is not realist and cannot help identify a theoretical
      core of sociology.</p>
      <p><br></p>
      <h3 id="inference-to-the-best-explanation">Inference to the best
      explanation</h3>
      <p>The final strategy discussed by Hawley is inferring social
      ontology from the best social science. It takes mature and
      predictively successful theories to be an approximation to what
      there really is. This position is known as scientific realism
      <span class="citation" data-cites="psillos1999">(Psillos,
      1999)</span>. Semantically, it takes scientific theories to be
      truth-conditioned descriptions of the structure of the world,
      meaning that they might be either true or false, and
      metaphysically it views the world as mind-independent and
      clustered into natural kinds<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a>. The semantic
      position of scientific realism implies fallibilism, for one’s
      theory might be mistaken about the world’s structure.</p>
      <p>Hawley criticises this strategy, for, as she points out, there
      is still massive divergence in social scientific paradigms, from
      rational choice [#insertSource] to hermeneutics and
      <em>Verstehen</em> [#insertSource]. According to Hawley, social
      science is not mature enough and does not have an agreed
      theoretical core which can generate plausible predictions. The
      predictive capacity, along with maturity of science, is a
      prerequisite for inference from scientific theory to ontology, as
      argued by <span class="citation" data-cites="psillos1999">Psillos
      (1999)</span>, to whom the author refers. In Hawley’s words,
      “there are no social analogues of the gravitational waves or Higgs
      boson which bring physics to the headlines“ <span class="citation" data-cites="hawley2018">(2018, p. 191)</span>. For the reasons of
      immaturity and the lack of shared foundations in social science,
      she discards inference to the best explanation (IBE) as a
      methodology for arriving at social ontology.</p>
      <p>The problem with Hawley’s position is that there would be no
      gravitational waves or Higgs bosons discovered without IBE in the
      first place. Of course, these discoveries did not bear massive
      ontological commitments and, hence, did not make any metaphysical
      claims. But it is further unification that allowed them to be put
      into a more coherent picture that philosophers can use to infer
      ontology from. In other words, IBE requires induction and
      empirical investigations in the first place to arrive at
      predictively successful and “mature” science. This goes in hand
      with Ross’s suggestions of ‘radically naturalist metaphysics’
      which consists solely of first-order science and uses induction

      This approach is rooted in the idea that metaphysical theories
      should evolve through empirical testing and reflection, rather
      than solely through abstract reasoning. Scholz highlights the
      necessity of making empirical assumptions explicit and testing

      <span class="citation" data-cites="lohse2017">Lohse (2017)</span>

      (2008)</span>, <span class="citation" data-cites="lauer2019">Lauer
      (2019)</span> reviews and critically assesses the argument that
      social ontology is prior to social scientific methodology, for it
      can promote success in prediction and explanation by providing a
      correct view of the social reality. For example, Searle notes that
      social ontology is prior to methodology and theory: “It is prior
      in the sense that unless you have a clear conception of the nature
      of the phenomena you are investigating, you are unlikely to
      develop the right methodology and the right theoretical apparatus
      for conducting the investigation” <span class="citation" data-cites="searle2008">(2008, p. 443)</span>. Epstein expresses a
      similar concern: “Ontology has ramifications, and ontological
      mistakes lead to scientific mistakes. Commitments about the nature
      of the entities in a science—how they are composed, the entities
      on which they ontologically depend—are woven into the models of
      the science” <span class="citation" data-cites="epstein2015">(2015, p. 127)</span>. Ontology affects
      methodology in the sense of defining relevant aspects of a
      phenomenon under consideration which influences the way to
      approach it. However, it is hard to define these aspects a priori.
      Social ontology is not prior to social methodology, for relevant
      aspects of phenomena are subject to empirical testing, and this
      applies to social science, as well.</p>
      <p><span class="citation" data-cites="little2020">Little

      <span class="citation" data-cites="epstein2015">Epstein
      (2015)</span> and <span class="citation" data-cites="searle2010">J. Searle (2010)</span>, he holds that
      social ontology is the most abstract edge of social scientific
      theorizing, and that it is iteratively connected with empirical
      investigation and theory formation. This stance presupposes
      similar inductive process as in the natural sciences and in
      principle supports inference from social science to social
      ontology. However, Little explicitly rejects the “unity of
      scientific ontology” implicit in Hawley’s reasoning, who
      presupposes inference from a “theoretical core” of science. The
      former implies pluralism and case-by-case investigation of social
      ontology similar to Kincaid’s contextualism <span class="citation" data-cites="kincaid2021">(Kincaid, 2021)</span>, and the latter
      implies monism regarding the focal set of entities and relations:
      there are “main” parts applicable across the board. Little denies
      the possibility of such a complete social ontology that might
      serve a foundation for social scientific reasoning and that “cuts
      the nature at its joints”. As he says, there are no such “joints”
      in social reality, meaning that there are no “atoms” or
      fundamental elements of it. Little also denies the idea that there
      might be a final list of entities from which the social world is
      composed and in terms of which all familiar social scientific
      concepts should be reformulated. In other words, Little’s realism
      is much weaker than scientific realism implied by Hawley, and this
      is why he sees no problem in accommodating realism for social
      ontology: these are just two different notions of the same
      title.</p>
      <p>Weak scientific realism like Little’s cannot be a robust answer
      to the “what there is” question regarding the social world, but it
      can be a starting point if it uses IBE.</p>
      <p>Is it possible to be a stronger scientific realist about social
      world? A helpful distinction here is that of natural and social
      kinds. Kinds are parts of the world naturally grouped together as
      opposed to classes which are grouped contingently. <span class="citation" data-cites="mill1843">(<strong>mill1843?</strong>)</span>
      connected kinds to scientific inferences and properties. <span class="citation" data-cites="boyd1991">Boyd (1991)</span>
      redefined them as “homeostatic property clusters”, for properties
      are correlated and “packed” together. “Homeostatic” refers to the
      stability of correlations which have underlying causal mechanisms
      explaining them. Kinds with such homeostatic properties are real
      kinds. They support inductive inference and generalisation, and
      are studied by the sciences. <em>Real</em> refers to either
      independence from representations or being genuine.</p>
      <p><span class="citation" data-cites="hacking1999">Hacking
      (1999)</span> introduced <em>interactive</em> and

      interactive kinds are not real in the Mill-Boyd sense due to the
      lack of stability and historical contingency, they rather lack
      necessity than stability, for if described as patterns of
      strategic interactions in game-theoretic sense, as Guala does,
      behavioral regularities and equilibria are indeed stable.</p>
      <p>The problem of social ontology might be reformulated as “are
      (some of) social kinds natural ones?” If yes and they indeed
      possess homeostatic properties independent from individuals’
      representations of them, they might be candidates for “basic”
      ontological units of the social world. It helps to identify a
      condition for successful IBE, namely, that an ontological unit in
      question should be a real rather than interactive kind so that it
      supports inductive inference. But the next question is how to
      identify a real kind?</p>

      sociology depart from different levels of description. One of the
      consequences of this is the well-known problem of micro-macro
      integration <span class="citation" data-cites="mouzelis2005">(Mouzelis, 2005)</span>: how
      micro-accounts of face-to-face social interactions relate to
      social institutions, states and world-systems. The problem of the
      “correct” level of description has been one of the key impediments
      for the development theoretical core of sociology and inference to
      ontological claims from it [#insertSource]. Both sociologists and
      philosophers tried to solve this problem throughout the 20th
      century, from “Grand theories” as Merton <span class="citation" data-cites="merton1949">(<strong>merton1949?</strong>)</span> has
      dubbed them <span class="citation" data-cites="parsons1937">(Parsons, 1937, #insertSource)</span> to
      recent advancements <span class="citation" data-cites="bourdieu">(<strong>elder-vassa?</strong>)</span>. In
      philosophy of social science, this problem has been addressed as
      the debate between individualism and holism and consists of the
      question over the primary ontological level of description of the
      social <span class="citation" data-cites="zahle2014">(Zahle &amp;
      Collin, 2014)</span>.</p>
      <p>Notably, the notion of “emergence” has been employed as a
      remedy for the individualism/holism (or micro/macro) struggle in
      social ontology and sociology respectively. Although scholars mean
      different things by ‘emergence’, the idea of new levels and
      entities coming into being as a result of interactions of entities
      on “lower levels” has been used quite widely, from implicit into

"Structure" here refers to *real patterns* as defined by @dennett1991 and massively elaborated by @ladyman2007. A pattern is considered real if it can be tracked and projected under various physical perspectives, encoding information about structure more efficiently than mere data representation. This makes it useful for predicting the world, aligning closely with scientific practices. However, as @beni2017 notes, the notion of projectibiity endorsed by Ladyman and Ross is insufficiency for metaphysical claims as capacity to track and project patterns into the future might be instrumental and not represent real patterns.-->

He says that the sociological notion of “social structure” presupposing relations between roles and positions instead of individuals and the notion of equilibrium arguments as discussed by @sober1983 are instances of structural relations. However, as Kincaid argues, social structural relations are not causal, but conceptual ones. Roles and institutions are defined in terms of each other. For example, professors are academics who teach at universities, and universities are places where students learn from professors. In this structural realist case mind-independence of social phenomena is not discussed directly, but is acknowledged via the notion of social structural relations as conceptual rather than causal. Another feature of structural realism is its reliance on mathematical descriptions which track real patterns in the world. Adherents of structural realism use them as a criteria for existence of phenomena.-->

      <!--Another option that explicitly addresses this problem is Guala's [-@guala2016b, ch. 12] proposal that social kinds are not strictly mind-independent as in “proper” scientific realism, but loosely depend on our representations of them. He takes Hacking's idea of reflexive loops and social kinds as interactive kinds seriously and argues that causal dependence of social kinds on representations does not preclude from realism. Causal dependence means that our beliefs about social kinds intervene on their nature. But would not this imply anti-realism and anti-fallibilism about social kinds? No, for Guala's social kinds are not only a product of our beliefs about them as it is in the “Standard model” discussed earlier, but also a product of repeated behavioral regularities captured as equilibria of strategic games. For Guala's approach uses equilibrium arguments, it is also about structure, and, in terms of Kincaid, it addresses the process how conceptual relations emerge via social coordination. However, the next, naturalistic step is to ask what are the causal mechanisms of emergence of conceptual, or institutional, relations and social roles?  -->

More importantly, he emphasizes that ontological positions are implicitly related to the models of cognition one employs, knowingly or not. -->
      <!---->
      <!--The “Hobbesian”, or autonomous agent social, presupposes that individual agents are rational deliberators. This view is largely seen in game theory. For example, @skyrms2014 uses evolutionary dynamics to show how Hobbesian social contract might have emerged. Although not discussed by Skyrms himself but pointed out by Turner, a position like this, seen from the perspective of the cognitive-social nexus, implies that the cognitive ontologically precedes and grounds the social. First there are fully formed cognitive agents able to deliberate and then their aggregate “produces” the social. This account leads to individualism stating that explanations of social phenomena should be put forward mostly in terms of individual agents and their actions or that only these exist. -->
      <!---->
      <!--Turner connects the “Hobbesian” model with the computational model of mind, where it is seen as an internal abstract process of calculation over representations. This means that deliberation is guaranteed by cognitive agents' ability to represent the world and calculate over these representations. This, in turn, has further implications regarding human cognitive architecture and more fundamental question like “is the mind modular?”, “if it is modular, have these modules evolved for serving specific task?”, and the like [@turner2018].  -->

      <!--In contrast, “pervasive” model of the social presupposes that the cognitive and the social are interdependent and affect each other in terms of evolutionary formed cognitive capacities serving certain needs. This means that agents, whose arrangements produce “the social”, are not fully autonomous, for they are themselves byproducts of the evolutionary formed social cognition and enculturation. This position is ontologically ambiguous, for it is not evident what are social entities here. This position might equally lead to holism, which states that social phenomena either exist over and above individuals or should be explained as independent of individualist explanations [@zahle2014] or to individualism. And if this “pervasive” model of the social might seem more empirically plausible from a naturalistic point of view according to recent research [@tomasello2014; @sterelny2012Book], what implications does it have for social ontology? These are open questions.-->
      <!---->
      <!--However, the more fundamental question is “are these models a dichotomy?”, for if not, it would mean that one does not have to choose a “right” model of the social and to subscribe to a correspondingly “right” model of cognition. I argue they are not — the relationship between “Hobbesian” and “pervasive” socials is not a dichotomy, but metaphysical grounding, where the former is ontologically dependent on the latter. It means that in order for a “Hobbesian” social to exist, there should be “pervasive” one in the first place.  -->

      <!--As Turner (2018) notes, coordination is the main mechanism of scaling up from autonomous agents to larger social groups and societies, which means that it is the main mechanism of the “Hobbesian” social. This is essentially what evolutionary game theory studies regarding social ontology. However, as @skyrms2010 illustrates using Lewis's [-@lewis2008] signaling games framework, coordination might have evolved from random signals which are not paired and attuned to each other to produce a coherent coordinated output. In addition, as Skyrms shows that ability to coordinate actions to produce a jointly optimal output is found even in animals, the cognitive requirements for the “Hobbesian” model might be significantly lowered. It means that to be capable of jointly coordinating to come to a social contract does not require ability for rational deliberation. However, this is exactly the part of Skyrms's model that is criticized for its inability to account for another parameters besides signals, i.e. metarepresentation, reading environmental cues like animals' tracks [@sterelny2017]. In other words, it is implausible from the point of view of human evolutionary history. -->
      <!---->
      <!--The issue with the “Hobbesian” model is twofold: its possibility conditions and its applicability to human social contracts. Taking into account Sterelny's critiques, it seems that cognitive requirements for animal and human coordination are different, for only humans have social institutions. He explains it with a human ability to decouple behavior from stimuli with the aid of representation of the environment [@sterelny2003]. It means that in terms of Skyrms, this is not only externalist random signals which are responsible for the eventual possibility of successful coordination, but representations of these signals as well, which are not accounted for in Skyrms's model. This happens to support Turner's insight on connection between computationalism and “Hobbesian” social.    -->
      <!---->
      <!--However, Sterelny's conjecture is not the only possible one out there. As @paternotte2014 notes, the issue with social evolution theories as a source for naturalistic social ontology consists in showing, why a certain cognitive factor was not only selected for in the first place, but remained robust in the course of evolutionary history. He lists three research strands possible for adopting as a source for coordination as the basis of social ontology. These are Machiavellian intelligence hypothesis stating that strategic abilities like deception, coalition formation and lie evolved, also entailing the capacity for beliefs about beliefs or metarepresentation; the shared intention hypothesis, that recognizes we-intentionality and ability for joint attention and sharing as basic for uniquely human sociality [@tomasello2010]; assisted learning hypothesis, that puts repeated cooperative challenges and adaptations to it as basic for human sociality [@sterelny2012Book]. -->

Sterelny expresses this shift in game-theoretic terms like a shift from fitness maximization to utility maximization, and explains it with the rapid growth of social groups in early Holocene and accompanying weakening of vertical cultural heritability.

It outlines the necessity for generative models of active output in understanding signaling conventions, highlights the importance of principles like functional information and co-evolution, and concludes by suggesting that as these elements evolve, they give rise to new forms of social agents capable of producing observable effects in their environment.-->

      <!--Any scientific ontology can be either realist or instrumentalist [#insertSource]. The former requires believing that scientific theories are approximately true rather than they are just empirically adequate and correctly describe the observable world, as the instrumentailst stance suggests [#insertSource]. Ontology remains a set of entities in a domain in question regardless of its existence claims. For instance, you do not need to believe that "symbolic social interaction" is an approximation to truth to study it, but you do need to believe in its relevance for acquiring new knowledge about social reality. -->

      <!--To get a more objective picture of what there is in the social realm, natural constraints are needed. They might provide evolutionary and cognitive grounds for social phenomena and thus constrain them and narrow down possible objects and methods of study. In other words, natural constraints for social ontology might be a measure to test theories against. There is an array of work in similar directions [@sperber; @turner2018; @kaidesoja2019]. However, these authors focus on the proximate question—how social phenomena might be related to cognitive ones—instead of an ultimate one—how evolution might have shaped human species to establish unique forms of sociality that are supposed to be a subject of a separate discipline, social science. Let us start with the notion of social ontology and proceed to its natural constraints.-->
      <!---->
      <!--According to @epstein2018, social ontology divides into two distinct inquiries. The first one deals with the constituents of social entities and addresses the question “what is the social world composed of?”. The second strand of research is concerned with the construction of social categories, or kinds, and with the question “how do social kinds like money, borders, marriage and others get established?”. Individual people constituting a social group exemplify the former inquiry and children playing a game where stuffed animals have a tea party exemplify the latter [@epstein2015, 57].-->
      <!---->
      <!--The difference between the strands is in the metaphysical relation of individuals and social facts. In the first case, social facts supervene on the facts about individuals, meaning that social properties cannot change without changing the individual ones. In the second case, facts about individuals set up the conditions for something to count as a social fact, i. e. dollar bills with a particular ink and paper and collective acceptance for money. [-@epstein2015, 58].-->
      <!---->
      <!--One of the most famous expressions of the latter is Searle's [-@searle1995] formula “X counts as Y in context C”. For example, "bills issued by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing (X) count as dollars (Y) in the United States (C)" [-@searle1995, 28]. Epstein calls the former relationship grounding and the latter anchoring, where grounding is responsible for instantiation conditions for being, say, money, in a particular context, and anchoring for the mechanism of how these conditions have been established. For example, in Searle's case, collective acceptance of the fact X is such a mechanism.[^3]-->
      <!---->
      <!--What makes social ontology "naturalistic" in terms of grounds and anchors? I take it to be naturalism about anchors, or a mechanism of bringing about instantiation conditions of a social entity. On this account, social ontology addresses natural constraints of, and their influence on, social phenomena, namely, the role of representations, mental states, their physical realization and evolution.-->
      <!---->
      <!--***-->
      <!---->
      <!--After all, what is naturalistic social ontology and how particularly to arrive at it using inductive strategy in a weaker, Little's “iterative process” form? I take naturalistic social ontology to be a scientifically realist position addressing mind-dependence of social kinds causally, not just by postulating beliefs, representations, or propositions but by studying evolved physically realized cognitive mechanisms and capacities supporting equilibrium explanations, for latter ones lack any mechanism [@hedstrom2010]. To arrive at such a position, one needs a “theoretical core” to “induce” from.-->
      <!---->
      <!--As Gintis [-@gintis2007; -@gintis2009a; @gintis2013] argues, social and behavioral sciences can be unified on the basis of game theory, which lends itself as this “core”. He argues that game theory is a "universal lexicon of life", for it "permits the precise framing of meaningful empirical assertions, but imposes no particular structure on the predicted behavior" [-@gintis2007, 8]. However, there have been quite massive doubts in such a general applicability of game theory [@guala2006]. In addition, according to @turner2007, social theory requires “sane” constraints: it ought to be physically, computationally and cognitively realistic. It means that its concepts and explanations must be grounded in physically realizable cognitive entities and be computationally tractable. Game theory, in this sense, only covers the computationally tractable aspect. All this implies that such a “core” can be assembled with more attention to naturalistic constraints.-->
      <!---->
      <!--## IBE with naturalistic constraints on social ontology-->
      <!---->
      <!--It seems that inference to the best explanation in regard of social ontology requires more explicit appeal to naturalistic components of such ontology. In particular, ones that address and illuminate the causal structure of mind-dependence of social kinds. But how to account for it?-->
      <!---->
      <!--According to @turner2007, social theory relies heavily on and makes generous use of mentalistic and cognitive concepts like “meaning”, “belief”, “collective representations” and the like, but at the same time it employs the strategy of minimizing the cognitive by using these concepts only metaphorically and not engaging with the actual cognitive science. He “sane” constraints of physical, computational and cognitive realism on social theory means that the concepts and explanations of social science must be grounded in physically realizable cognitive entities and be computationally tractable. He draws on @guala2016 who discusses the possibility of attaining an equilibrium without explicit prior agreement with the help of a physical marker that he calls a “focal point”, sketchily connects domains of joint attention, focal points, correlated equilibria and social coordination and suggests that “*we can think of actual societies as made up of multiple focal points which are the subject of joint attention by different overlapping groups, as the distributed rather than centralized source of multiple modes of coordination*” ([@turner2018, 209]). Thus, he makes preliminary steps towards meeting his own theoretical constraints. These, however, are not elaborated yet, but the direction is seen vividly. And if game-theoretic explanations of coordination might be said to be computationally realistic in their description of attaining and sustaining an equilibrium, i.e. by inductive learning [@vanderschraaf2001], the other two requirements remain unsatisfied.-->
      <!---->
      <!--From another perspective, @sperber2011 proposes a framework for naturalistic and mechanistic social ontology with his approach of epidemiology of representations [-@sperber1996]. It consists of sub-personal social cognitive causal chains that secure the relationship between inputs and outputs. Social phenomena, according to Sperber, are "causal chains of mental events inside people and events in their common environment" [-@sperber2011, 71]. Sperber's ontological proposition is constrained by cognitive events, but it is limited, for as it sees social entities like institutions as hierarchically nested sets of stabilized representations and behaviors, it does not address (1) the mind-dependence of social entities on representations, (2) causal emergence of these representations in the first place and (3) normative force of these representations. Moreover, Sperber's idea about stabilization of representations' contents as the main ontological mechanism and explanatory target of naturalistic social science is quite close to formal naturalistic theories of meaning and representation relying on evolutionary game theory [see @harms2004]. It means that his account is also incomplete and cannot be used as a sole source for sought after "core" to induce social ontology from.-->
      <!---->
      <!--In a helpful discussion, @sarkia2020 propose a framework illuminating the division of labor between cognitive and social scientists studying social phenomena including coordination which is based on mechanistic philosophy of science [@craver2013; @glennan2017]. Its main idea is that mechanisms for phenomena consist of entities “whose activities and interactions are organized so as to be responsible for the phenomenon" [@glennan2017, 17]. Drawing on Bechtel's [-@bechtel2009] exposition of mechanistic explanation in cognitive science, the authors suggest that such explanations might be given by answering four questions:-->
      <!---->
      <!--- (1) what is the phenomenon?-->
      <!--- (2) what entities and processes it consists of?-->
      <!--- (3) what are the interactions of these entities contributing to the phenomenon? (4) what is the environment where the mechanism is situated, and how does it affect its functioning?-->
      <!---->
      <!--The division of labor, the authors argue, is accomplished by answering different sets of Bechtel's questions. Evolutionary anthropologists and developmental psychologists answer the first and the fourth of them by studying the key differences between human and great ape cognitive capacities and development of uniquely human ones in the course of human ontogeny. In their turn, cognitive scientists answer the second and third questions by identifying particular cognitive mechanisms, for instance, entrainment and common object affordances[^7]. In addition, Sarkia and colleagues put forward the idea that social scientists might address further questions outlying those suggested by Bechtel, i.e. complex social networks emergent from social coordination.-->
      <!---->
      <!--In addition, @ignatow2014 suggests that to further develop sociological theory (so that we can induce ontology from it), it is needed to account for the recent developments in both cognitive and computational sciences. To do that, he argues, it is first needed to take a stand in the philosophy of social science debates regarding ontology. He proposes that an ontology of cognitive sociology to be both realist and constructionist, for experimental methods like magnetic resonance imaging reveal real phenomena which are used to explain how individuals interpret and navigate the social world. The ontological and epistemological stances of cognitive sociology, according to Ignatow, are compatible with various versions of philosophical realism, in particular, Elder-Vass's “realist constructionism” [@elder-vass2007] and Kajdesoja's “naturalized” critical realism without metaphysics [@kaidesoja2013b].-->
      <!---->
      <!--In a similar vein, discussing the integration of cognitive and social sciences, @kaidesoja2019, following @sun2012a and @bloch2012, suggest that cognitive explanations ground and constrain social ones. It means that cognitive explanations are more ontologically fundamental, and that social explanations partly depend on the cognitive ones and are supervening on them. They call this approach “bottom-up” for its attention to causal mechanisms that underlie and enable specific phenomena. At the same time, they criticize Gintis's approach to integration via game-theoretic unification [@gintis2007; @gintis2009a] for its inability to account for causal mechanisms and for heavy reliance on a rational actor model, which implies “economics imperialism” [@maki2009], which is roughly an over-use of the rational actor model. Gintis's main theoretical claim in this context is that the rational actor model and game theory, when modified to take into account the evolved nature of human psychology and the sociocultural theory of norms seen through the lens of game theory, provide a unified modeling framework for behavioral sciences. Kaidesoja and colleagues call this approach “top-down” for its emphasis on fitting the phenomena studied in behavioral sciences like sociology, psychology, and anthropology within a general theoretical framework of game theory in order to understand them. Regarding the approaches discussed by Kaidesoja and colleagues, both “top-down” and “bottom-up” ones only partially satisfy Turner's constraints.-->
      <!---->
      <!--To satisfy computational, cognitive and physical criteria for a theoretical core of social science to induce ontology from, one needs to address the conceptual limits of game-theory and push it towards evolutionary explanations of cognitive capacities responsible for social cognition. It implies assuming rationality, but it is not limited only to economic one. The notions of “optimality” and “evolutionary rationality” are key in this context [@okasha2012; @okasha2017; @hammerstein2012], for they provide a framework for describing social choice as a phenomenon guided by cognitive optimization which is favored by natural selection. One of the main arguments of evolutionary decision theory is that both the evolutionary process and organisms can be seen “as if” they are rational [@okasha2012; @okasha2018]. This means that phylogenetic characteristics of organisms, including some emitted human and anibehavior,vior are being optimized or approximately optimal. However, this theory does not predict that humans will optimize anything on purpose in the course of everyday life. Instead, it says that evolution puts constraints and favors behavior leading to adaptive ends.-->
      <!---->
      <!--@turner2018 talks about “Verstehen bubble”, which is essentially the Weberian realm of the meaningful and intelligible [@weber1924]. His point is that this “bubble” has biological and cognitive conditions of possibility — mirror neurons are responsible for the very capacity of empathy, which is required to “understand” something [@turner2019]. My position is akin to Turner's in that there is a causal basis for social phenomena rooted in cognition, but it is also different in the sense that I am more interested in the ultimate explanation of the influence of cognition to social phenomena, whereas Turners seems to be more up with a proximal one, for he is interested in how these are connected.-->
      <!---->
      <!--## Conclusion-->
      <!---->
      <!--These have been several considerations to address and incorporate into a more general, naturalistically constrained social theory to induce ontology from, which I lay out in detail elsewhere [@shevchenko2023]. All in all, naturalistic social ontology needs both empirically successful formal game-theoretic models of social coordination and cognitive mechanisms that explain how this coordination is possible. If a naturalist social ontologist starts, like Guala, from the the game-theoretic part that supports realism about observable behavioral strategies at equilibrium, she stumbles upon the need for cognitive mechanisms responsible for it. And if this ontologist starts, like Sperber, from the cognitive part that supports realism about cognitive states and ontological reduction of social phenomena to these states, she arrives at the need for a unifying mechanism, in the light of which the relation between these cognitive states make sense. To sum up, it is possible to arrive at naturalistic social ontology using game theory as “theoretical core” of social science supplemented by its cognitive and evolutionary constraints.-->

      <p><!--Ontological theorizing regarding social science can be implicit or explicit. You can find the former inscribed into sociological theories and the latter postulated by philosophers of social science and metaphysicians. For instance, classical sociological theories, from Durkheim to Parsons, presupposed certain ontological commitments by postulating theories' main parts like social facts as the "collective ways of thinking, feeling, and acting that exist outside the individual" which lead to the idea of social phenomena existing independently and irreducible to individuals [@durkheim2014]. Explicit social ontology studies the "nuts and bolts" of the social world and its properties and does not try to explain social phenomena. It "competes" with social scientific methodology for the primacy. Philosophers like Epstein [-@epstein2015] and Searle [-@searle1995, -@searle2010] argue that without *analytically* circumscribing the objects of study in advance it is impossible to arrive at an adequate scientific methodology. Others deny such a priori theorizing and put empirical research first while seeing ontology as theoretical reflection or useful instrumental fiction[^3]. --></p>
      <!--One of the problems of arriving at a non-contradictory theoretical core in sociology is, as I will argue, the *lack of ontological constraints on concepts* which means that concepts are not well-substantiated with empirical data. More broadly, it is a lack of commitment criteria for concepts: when and how do we understand that a concept is substantiated and "is fine". This lack allows for proliferation of objects of study, and, since they are closely tied to possible methods of study, it presumably might have led to the current situation of a multi-paradigm (or pre-paradigm) science. What this lack precisely is, where does it come from, what are the conditions for its resolution and what happens after it, are the points discussed in the remainder of this chapter.-->

      argues, <em>“To use a questionnaire, to use an attitude scale, to
      take the role of participant observer, to select a random sample,
      to measure rates of population growth and so on, is to be involved
      in conceptions of the world which allow these instruments to be
      used for the purposes conceived. No technique or method of
      investigation (and this is as true of the natural sciences as it
      is of the social) is self-validating: its effectiveness, i.e. its
      very status as a research instrument making the world tractable to
      investigation, is, from a philosophical point of view, ultimately
      dependent on epistemological justifications”</em> <span class="citation" data-cites="hughes1990">(<strong>hughes1990?</strong>)</span>.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>

      <li id="fn3"><p>For example, <span class="citation" data-cites="kuhn2009">Kuhn (2009)</span> discusses the issue in
      terms of paradigm change, or change in conceptual networks through
      which scientists see the objects of their disciplines. In
      addition, Epstein discusses ontological mistakes leading to
      scientific ones in biology and social science <span class="citation" data-cites="epstein2015">(Epstein, 2015, pp.

      <li id="fn4"><p>For example, Hawley says that “there are no social
      analogues of the gravitational waves or Higgs boson which bring
      physics to the headlines“ <span class="citation" data-cites="hawley2018">(2018, p. 191)</span>, and hence, social
      science cannot generate plausible predictions. Some critics, most
      notably, Gintis <span class="citation" data-cites="gintis2007 gintis2013">(2007; Gintis &amp; Helbing,
      2013)</span>, call this diversified state of the social sciences

      <li id="fn5"><p>Such “sociological ontology” can be found almost

      <li id="fn7"><p>Metaphysics differ from ontology in that the
